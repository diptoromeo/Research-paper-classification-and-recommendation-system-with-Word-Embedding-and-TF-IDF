	<paper_heading>Investigation of viscous coupling effects in three-phase flow by lattice Boltzmann direct simulation and machine learning technique</paper_heading>
	<author>Fei Jiang, Jianhui Yang, Edo Boek, Takeshi Tsuji</author>
	<abstract>The momentum transfer across fluid interfaces in multi-phase flow leads to a non-negligible viscous coupling effect. In this study, we use the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as a direct simulator to solve the three-phase flow at pore scale. The viscous coupling effects are investigated for various fluid configurations in simple pore geometries with different conditions in terms of saturation, wettability and viscosity ratio. It is found that the viscous coupling effect can be significant for certain configurations. A parametric modification factor for conventional three-phase conductance model is then proposed to estimate the viscous coupling effect. The modification factor as a function of viscosity ratios can be easily incorporated into existing pore network model (PNM) to eliminate errors from viscous coupling effect. Moreover, an elegant approach using machine learning technique is proposed to predict the multi-phase permeability by a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from the direct simulation database. Such data-driven approach can be extended to develop a more sophisticated PNM for a better prediction of transport properties taking account of the viscous coupling effects.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Dual-scale pore network reconstruction of vugular carbonates using multi-scale imaging techniques</paper_heading>
	<author>Abolfazl Moslemipour, Saeid Sadeghnejad</author>
	<abstract>Vuggy carbonate rocks have a complex geometry with pore size ranges from nano to several millimeters (e.g., vugs). Compared to other rocks (e.g., sandstones), this multiscale nature makes pore-scale studies very challenging. Vugs have significant effects on rock properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, capillary pressure, etc.) by establishing high conductive pathways. Multiscale pore network models can capture pores across various length scales and can be used to predict the flow behavior of these porous systems. In this study, a dual-scale PNM is implemented to reconstruct the behavior of a vuggy carbonate sample. The rock sample is CT scanned at two different scales. At the macro-scale (i.e., vugular-network), a medical-CT scanner is used to image the rock sample at the resolution of 100 μm. For better visualization of macropores (i.e., vugs) of the rock sample, imaging is conducted at both dry and saturated states with an X-ray attenuating brine (i.e., NaI solution). The rock is also imaged by a micro-CT scanner at the resolution of 0.75 μm to extract the micro-scale properties (i.e., micro-network). The images at both scales are preprocessed first. Then, the networks of both scales are extracted by two network extraction algorithms (i.e., the sub-network of the over-segmented watershed (SNOW) and the Maximal Ball (MB) method), and the results compared together. Then, a stochastically equivalent network based on the extracted micro-network properties is generated with a larger field of view (FOV). Then, vugs are randomly added to the reconstructed micro-network based on the properties of the macro-scale CT images. The result is a dual-scale unstructured irregular PNM. This modeling approach can efficiently preserve the vug-to-vug and vug-to-pore connectivity of overlapping vugs. The results show that the reconstructed dual-scale PNM has very close properties to the laboratory measurement data of the real rock sample</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A vulnerability assessment method to evaluate the impact of tunnel drainage on terrestrial vegetation under various atmospheric and climatic conditions</paper_heading>
	<author>Cagri Gokdemir, Yoram Rubin, Xiaojun Li, Hao Xu</author>
	<abstract>The impact of tunnel drainage on local water resources has attracted increasing attention in the past decades. The potential impacts of tunnel drainage on terrestrial vegetation have been evaluated from a groundwater environment perspective. However, previous attempts did not consider the atmospheric and climatic conditions along with the change to the regional groundwater table. To address the lack of atmospheric influence, this study proposes a vulnerability assessment method focused on the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum by taking tunnel drainage, atmospheric and climatic impacts into account. The proposed method consists of five stages: (1) groundwater seepage model for water table distribution, (2) topsoil model based on a single column perspective for soil water pressure distributions, (3) dynamic root-zone wilting for the transient model, (4) Budyko-type analysis for the soil water storage under longer-term climatic changes, and (5) summary based on the outcomes of vulnerability analysis. The case study was located in the Yuexi county (Anhui, East China) and was investigated based on different soil textures, weather conditions, and groundwater table drawdown scenarios. Transient intra-annual water pressure dynamics were simulated for one year, and aggregate variations of soil water storage were summarized using the Budyko framework. The assessment method demonstrated that the textural differences and climatic changes are more impactful on plant vulnerability compared to the drainage effect in the specific case. The increase in aridity towards the sub-humid dry climate drives the soil columns to decrease the water storage, where the significant loss of water storage was also observed in the Budyko-type framework. The outcomes suggest that under sub-humid dry conditions when combined with tunnel drainage, the drawdown on shallow groundwater levels leads the vegetation to be vulnerable.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Transport pathway identification in fractured aquifers: A stochastic event synchrony-based framework</paper_heading>
	<author>Ahmed Yosri, Sarah Dickson-Anderson, Ahmad Siam, Wael El-Dakhakhni</author>
	<abstract>Several approaches are commonly applied to modeling fractured aquifers, including stochastic continuum (SC) and discrete fracture network (DFN) models. While DFN models provide a more realistic representation of the system, their development necessitates an accurate characterization of the fracture network. Extensive, and often prohibitive, resources are typically required to map a reliable fracture network, which is essential to develop an effective DFN model. The present study develops and demonstrates a simple framework for mapping transport pathways in fractured systems utilizing the coherence between solute transport and the lagged interdependence between two time series evaluated through the stochastic event synchrony (SES) technique. The SES-based framework was applied to solute breakthrough curves obtained i) analytically at different locations along a single, synthetic fracture both with and without matrix diffusion; and, ii) numerically at multiple locations within a synthetic, impervious fracture network. In all cases, the framework was capable of accurately mapping the transport pathways represented by direct pathes between the locations considered. The framework was also capable of identifying the hydrogeologic characteristics within each connection (i.e., flow velocity or its relationship to the dispersion coefficient). This framework is expected to significantly reduce the extensive resources required to identify the transport pathways within complex fractured aquifers. Additionally, the SES-based transport pathways identified may be used to enhance the reliability of other fracture network mapping, or generation, approaches by representing an additional constraint. This study is the first in the field of hydrogeology to adopt synchronization analysis and is expected to open the gate for using SES to address related problems</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A data-driven analysis of frequent patterns and variable importance for streamflow trend attribution</paper_heading>
	<author>Xiang Zeng, Spencer Schnier, Ximing Cai</author>
	<abstract>Identifying key driving forces for streamflow variation is essential for improving sustainable water resource management in terms of understanding how changes in the watershed translate to changes in streamflow. In this study, the relationships between trends in total annual streamflow and trends in watershed characteristics across the contiguous U.S. during 1981-2016 are investigated with data from 2,621 USGS gages. The regions of homogeneous hydrologic change, i.e. watersheds that are undergoing similar statistically significant streamflow trends, are delineated and frequent pattern mining (i.e. Apriori algorithm) and variable importance (i.e. Random Forest) are used to derive the key driving forces for these regions. As expected, the trends in streamflow are highly associated with the trends of precipitation. In contrast, the influences of anthropogenic factors vary substantially across regions. Particularly, the influence of water use change tends to be significant in the regions dominated by agricultural land, e.g. Dakotas. The importance of land use change is highlighted in the regions with relatively large forest coverage, e.g. Northeast. However, these important identified water use changes are not frequently associated with the increasing streamflow in sub-regions, e.g. Great Lakes, and thus the significance of the water use impacts are site-specific. Therefore, the changes in climate and land use are frequently and importantly identified together in the sub-regions with increasing streamflow, which can be collectively used to discover the major causes of the streamflow trends in those regions. Although the impacts of changing water use are highlighted in the Southwest, climate trends are primarily responsible for the decreasing streamflow.

	<paper_heading>On the dynamics of quasi-steady gravity currents flowing up a slope</paper_heading>
	<author>M.C. De Falco, C. Adduce, M.E. Negretti, E.J. Hopfinger</author>
	<abstract>Quasi-steady gravity currents propagating first on a horizontal and then up a sloping boundary are investigated by means of theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments. The bottom slope ranged from 0.18 to 1 and full- and partial-depth configurations were considered. The developed theoretical model, using the depth averaged momentum equation, provides new physical insight into the importance of the different forces that act on the current and accounts for the gravity component along the slope, whose effect increases with both the slope angle and the ratio of current to ambient fluid depths. The height of the current decreases linearly with up-slope distance and the spatial rate of decrease, expressed by the current shape parameter is determined from the theory, using the measured up slope distance at which the current stops. This current shape parameter is found to depend on the slope only and it is not dependent on the current to ambient fluid depths. It can then be used to calculate the current velocity and the up-slope distance reached by the current. It is shown that the front velocity of all performed experiments is predicted by the theory indicating that the theory remains valid up to a slope equal to 1.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Comparison of pore-scale capillary pressure to macroscale capillary pressure using direct numerical simulations of drainage under dynamic and quasi-static conditions</paper_heading>
	<author>Santosh Konangi, Nikhil K. Palakurthi, Nikolaos K. Karadimitriou, Ken Comer, Urmila Ghia</author>
	<abstract>Conventional macroscale two-phase flow equations for porous media (such as Darcy's law and Richards Equation) require a constitutive relation for capillary pressure (Pc). The capillary pressure relation significantly impacts the behavior and prediction of fluid flow in porous media, and needs to accurately characterize the capillary forces. In a typical laboratory experiment, a functional macroscopic capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-Sw) relationship is measured as the difference between the pressures of the non-wetting-phase reservoir at the inlet (Pnw) and wetting-phase reservoir at the outlet (Pw) of a porous medium. It is well-known that this traditional macroscopic capillary pressure definition is valid only at equilibrium conditions and if the phases are connected. Under non-equilibrium (dynamic) conditions, when the fluids are moving, the macroscopic capillary pressure measured in experiments implicitly includes the pressure head caused by viscous effects. The goal of the present effort is to understand how well the traditional macroscopic capillary pressure definition represents the pore-scale capillary forces under different flow conditions. Using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of two-phase flow in a porous medium, we evaluate the capillary pressure at the pore-scale, and compare it to the macroscopic capillary pressure, Pc(Sw), that is typically measured in experiments using pressure transducers. The pore-scale capillary pressure is the pressure difference across the interface between two fluids as the fluids move through a porous medium; the interface pressure differences at fluid-fluid invasion front are averaged across all the pores of the porous medium to yield a representative pore-scale capillary pressure curve, referred to as the interface capillary pressure. The pore-scale interface capillary pressure represents the “true” capillary forces in the system, since depends only on the pore morphology (shape) and interfacial energy of the two fluids, and does not account for the viscous dissipation. In experiments it is difficult to measure the interface capillary pressure jump without accounting for the viscous pressure head, which is at least an order of magnitude larger. Upscaling the pore-scale capillary pressure is an essential step for complete characterization of capillary-dominant two-phase flow in a porous medium at the laboratory scale. Drainage is simulated under equilibrium (quasi-static) and non-equilibrium (dynamic) conditions for various capillary numbers. The Navier–Stokes (NS) equations are solved in the pore space using the open-source finite-volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, OpenFOAM. The Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method is employed to track the evolution of the fluid–fluid interfaces, and a contact angle is used to account for the effect of wall adhesion. The simulations are first validated with published experimental data for dynamic and quasi-static drainage in a micromodel. From the microscale simulations, the interface capillary pressure is determined, and compared to the macroscopic capillary pressure under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. Our results show the traditionally-measured macroscopic capillary pressure curves exhibit a strong dependence on the capillary number under dynamic flow conditions. In contrast, the interface capillary pressure-saturation relation, which relies on pore-scale pressure differences at the invasion front, is almost invariant of flow conditions (dynamic and quasi-static).

	<author>Inga Berre, Wietse M. Boon, Bernd Flemisch, Alessio Fumagalli, ... Patrick Zulian</author>
	<abstract>Flow in fractured porous media occurs in the earth’s subsurface, in biological tissues, and in man-made materials. Fractures have a dominating influence on flow processes, and the last decade has seen an extensive development of models and numerical methods that explicitly account for their presence. To support these developments, four benchmark cases for single-phase flow in three-dimensional fractured porous media are presented. The cases are specifically designed to test the methods’ capabilities in handling various complexities common to the geometrical structures of fracture networks. Based on an open call for participation, results obtained with 17 numerical methods were collected. This paper presents the underlying mathematical model, an overview of the features of the participating numerical methods, and their performance in solving the benchmark cases.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>ACPAR: A framework for linking national water and food security management with global conditions</paper_heading>
	<author>Ahmed Abdelkader, Amin Elshorbagy</author>
	<abstract>In this paper, we identify cropping pattern as a major policy variable. A framework for the generation of alternative cropping patterns (ACPs) in arid regions, called ACPAR, is developed for assessing water and food security. ACPAR is applied to the case study of Egypt, for which a simulation-based national water, food, and trade (NWFT) model exists. ACPAR is formulated to minimize the agricultural water demand, food imports, and the economic cost of imports as well as maximize the national gross margin of agriculture. These four objective functions are optimized to generate ACPs that have different tradeoffs. Additional filtering criteria are employed to account for fertilizer use as well as the stability of the set objectives. The ACPs are generated and evaluated for the baseline period (1986-2013) as well as under future conditions up to the year 2050. The results show that ACPAR is useful for proposing ACPs that could have worked better for Egypt during the baseline period, but also ACPs that outperform the historical cropping pattern in each objective function for wide future conditions. Some of the generated future ACPs can perform well regarding irrigation water use and cost of imports, without compromising food self-sufficiency. The quantified tradeoffs between the identified objective functions are the key contributions of this study, representing important information for policymakers to aid in water resources planning. The ACPAR framework connects national water resource management decisions to global food production, consumption, and trade dynamics.</abstract>

	<author>Ankita Singh, Arash Rabbani, Klaus Regenauer-Lieb, Ryan T. Armstrong, Peyman Mostaghimi</author>
	<abstract>Understanding fluid flow in complex fractured porous media requires an accurate representation of the pore space, especially in the presence of both granular pores and fractures, which significantly differ in their geometries. The effect of such a complex fluid pathway is prominent in fractured sandstones and carbonates, which store a significant amount of energy resources. Digital core analysis allows three-dimensional imaging of rock cores at high resolutions to capture essential features such as granular pores, fractures, and minerals. These features are represented by a multi-modal grey-level histogram. Later, segmentation techniques are applied to these images to uniquely differentiate pores (fractures and granular pores) from minerals. However, these segmentation routines are purely based on grey-level intensities and hence, are incapable of automatically segregating the pore space into granular pores and fractures. This paper applies a computer vision technique called contour detection for structural analysis of the entire pore space. Since fractures are mainly considered planar features, we carry out a slice-by-slice analysis on 3D segmented images of fractured sandstones and carbonates. Contours of pores (granular pores and fractures) and their structural properties are read into a principal component analysis followed by a K-means clustering algorithm to segregate granular pores from fractures. The exploratory analysis showed that the optimum number of principal components required for segregation is 2 for both sandstones and carbonates. The test for generalization used the above information for K-means clustering in x, y, and z directions. The voxels identified as fractures and granular pores are then merged to give a 3D representation of fractures showing an accuracy greater than 89% when compared to the ground truth labels. The permeability differences between reconstructed and labelled fractures for digitally fractured samples were less than 9% for all the directions. This analysis provides pathways to better understand competing fluid flow phenomena in pores and fractures and aids in the extraction of pore network models for complex fractured porous media.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Physical versus virtual water transfers to overcome local water shortages: A comparative analysis of impacts</paper_heading>
	<author>Fatemeh Karandish, Rick J. Hogeboom, Arjen Y. Hoekstra</author>
	<abstract>Water shortages pose significant threats to local water security and food production around the world. Water managers have resorted to various water resources planning measures to overcome these challenges. For the first time and for a case study in Iran, we provide a comparative analysis of two such measures: physical and virtual inter-basin water transfers (IBWT). We evaluate green and blue water footprints (WF) associated with the production of 39 crops grown in humid Mazandaran and arid Semnan provinces, under (i) current production patterns and current local water availability; (ii) current production patterns and a planned physical IBWT scheme between Mazandaran (donor) and (receiving) Semnan province to provide water to water-intensive crops in the latter; (iii) modified cropping patterns, such that surplus production of water-intensive crops in Mazandaran abates production in Semnan province, coupled with interprovincial trade (i.e., a virtual IBWT scheme). We find that crops currently produced in Mazandaran have considerably lower blue WFs per unit of production (m3 t−1) and a higher economic blue water productivity (EBWP, $ m−1) than in Semnan province. A physical IBW would reduce blue water scarcity (BWS) in Semnan province by 34%, but at the cost of reduced EBWP by up to 46% of crops irrigated with the more costly transferred water. A virtual IBWT would reduce BWS in Semnan province to the same degree, while only modestly increasing BWS in Mazandaran province (from 0.15 to 0.21, indicating that Mazandaran water resources can sustainably support the proposed increase in production). Moreover, Mazandaran's provincial average EBWP is even raised (by 7%) in the virtual IBWT scenario.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Solute transport in bounded porous media characterized by generalized sub-Gaussian log-conductivity distributions</paper_heading>
	<author>Guillem Sole-Mari, Monica Riva, Daniel Fernàndez-Garcia, Xavier Sanchez-Vila, Alberto Guadagnini</author>
	<abstract>There are increasing evidences that probability distributions and associated statistical moments of a variety of hydrogeological and soil science variables and their spatial increments display distinctive scale-dependent features that are not captured by a typical Gaussian model. A Generalized Sub-Gaussian (GSG) model is able to capture key aspects of this pattern. We present the results of a suite of computational analyses set in a Monte Carlo framework and aimed at assessing the impact of a GSG structure of log hydraulic conductivity (Y) on transport of a conservative solute through a three-dimensional bounded porous medium under steady-state saturated Darcy flow. Our results indicate that the longitudinal spreading of a plume is on average significantly smaller for Sub-Gaussian than for Gaussian Y fields. Otherwise, the velocity field arising from a Sub-Gaussian Y field induces enhanced plume stretching with respect to what can be observed in a Gaussian Y setting, this aspect potentially influencing the strength of solute mixing within these two types of conductivity domains. We also find that, in some cases, it may be difficult to identify the nature of the underlying conductivity field relying solely on observations of solute concentrations migrating within the system. In this regard, we show that the action of local dispersion tends to mask the influence of Sub-Gaussianity on major transport metrics.</abstract>

	<author>Mohammad H. Alobaidi, Taha B.M.J. Ouarda, Prashanth R. Marpu, Fateh Chebana</author>
	<abstract>Low-flow estimation at ungagged sites is a challenging task. Ensemble-based machine learning regression has recently been utilized in modeling hydrologic phenomena and showed improved performance compared to classical regional regression approaches. Ensemble modeling mainly revolves around developing a proper training framework of the individual learners and combiners. An ensemble framework is proposed in this study to drive the generalization ability of the sub-ensemble models and the ensemble combiners. Information mixtures between the subsamples are introduced and, unlike common ensemble frameworks, are explicitly devoted to the ensemble members as well as ensemble combiners. The homogeneity paradigm is developed via a two-stage resampling approach, which creates sub-samples with controlled information mixture levels for the training of the individual learners. Artificial neural networks are used as sub-ensemble members in combination with a number of ensemble integration techniques. The proposed model is applied to estimate summer and winter low-flow quantiles for catchments in the province of Québec, Canada. The results show significant improvement when compared to the other models presented in the literature. The obtained homogeneity levels from the optimum ensemble models demonstrate the importance of utilizing the diversity concept in ensemble learning applications.

	<paper_heading>Improving parameter and state estimation of a hydrological model with the ensemble square root filter</paper_heading>
	<author>Ning Li, Wolfgang Kinzelbach, Haitao Li, Wenpeng Li, Fei Chen</author>
	<abstract>Data assimilation techniques are widely used in hydrology and water resources management to improve model forecast uncertainty by assimilating observations. The big challenge in practical applications is how to describe model uncertainties correctly to avoid the occurrence of spurious covariance during data assimilation. In this study, the ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) is used to estimate parameters and states of a groundwater model in Guantao, China, which updates ensemble means and perturbations separately and avoids the need to perturb observations. The uncertainty in parameters and states decreased with time while assimilating observations. However, incorrect updates of parameters and states were obtained, which could not be corrected by assimilating further observations improving the representation of the hydrological system. To compensate for this effect and reduce other sampling errors introduced during assimilation, localization and two covariance-tuning methods (inflation factor and damping factor) are explored in the study. The results show that alternative scenarios with proper localization length or a large inflation factor or a small damping factor produce better model estimates and improve the filter performance. The scenario with a damping factor of 0.05 shows a distinct gain in model predictive capability. The damping factor method is superior to the inflation factor method and preferable in real field applications. The scenario combining the damping factor with localization further improved the filter performance. The performance of the EnSRF with respect to different amounts of measurement error is also analysed. Even though the increase of observation error can increase the error covariance, a corresponding filter improvement is not observed as in that case, observations are less informative.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A machine learning model of virtual water networks over time</paper_heading>
	<author>Fiorella Oreggioni, Susana Garcia, Michael Gomez, Alfonso Mejia</author>
	<abstract>Virtual water flows are used to determine the indirect water requirements of a region or product, making them an indispensable tool for water sustainability analysis and assessment. Commodity flows are a key data needed to compute virtual water but are typically available every 5 years in the United States (US). The lack of continuous, annual commodity flow data severely limits our ability to study and understand the drivers, evolution, and alterations of virtual water in the US. We build and evaluate a machine learning model using Random Forest (RF) to predict annual commodity and virtual water flow networks. The model is used to perform several modeling experiments and illustrate the prediction of annual virtual water flows in the US during 2013–2018. We show that the RF predictions consistently outperform those from a gravity model. The overall performance of the RF algorithm improves as commodities or regions are aggregated into coarser groups. Likewise, the inclusion of past commodity flows as an additional explanatory variable enhances the RF performance. The combination of RF classification and regression allows predicting both network connections and flows without comprising performance. Based on our RF predictions for 2013–2018, we find that temporal variations in virtual water flows can be large for some regions in the US, underscoring the need addressed by this study of reconstructing domestic virtual water changes over time. By capturing inter-regional water consumption interactions in space and time, such reconstructed data could be beneficial in the future for anticipating and managing local and regional water scarcity.</abstract>

	<abstract>To consider the non-Darcian nature of groundwater flow and the permeability reduction owing to well and aquifer clogging, an Izbash's law-based analytical model with a time-dependent hydraulic conductivity function is proposed for constant-rate recharge and constant-head recharge. By means of linearization approximations, variable substitutions and the Laplace transform, approximate analytical solutions for the model are derived. Comparison of developed approximate analytical solutions with numerical solutions indicates that the approximate solutions are highly accurate except during the short period of initial recharge stage. The proposed model provides a theoretical basis for managed aquifer recharge involving clogging-related permeability reduction and non-Darcian flow.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Response of dual-zone heterogeneous wedge-shaped aquifers under steady-state pumping and regional flow</paper_heading>
	<author>Ali Mahdavi</author>
	<abstract>Natural hydrogeological settings may delineate wedge-shaped aquifers that are sandwiched between streams, lakes or sea water bodies along arbitrary-oriented boundary lines. This is the case in multiple river basins, river deltas, alluvial fans, and coastal promontories and heterogeneity patterns are likely to arise because of sedimentation zoning. The aim of present study is to provide a steady-state analytical solution describing the nature of well extraction in heterogeneous wedge-shaped aquifers formed by intersection of arbitrary-oriented streams. This laterally bounded aquifer comprises two zones of constant but differing transmissivity (hydraulic conductivity) which are hydraulically connected through a common interface. First, the method of Green's function constructs a closed-form expression for the spatial distribution of dual-zone potential. Next, the stream function is derived from the integration of Cauchy-Riemann equations which in turn completes an analytical representation of the flow net. The stream depletion rates are shown to be explicitly linked to the stream function. This leads to simple expressions for the stream depletion rates, demonstrating that the lateral recharge from adjacent streams varies linearly with the angular position of pumping well without any dependency on the aquifer heterogeneity. The present solution encompasses a number of existing solutions for homogeneous aquifer system as subsets. Flow nets are generated for hypothetical test cases whereby stagnation points are identified semi-analytically. The present formulation ensures preservation of water balance for a capture zone subject to regional flow. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to address how drawdown at a certain observation point responds to a heterogeneity perturbation. Wider wedges appear more sensitive to variation of heterogeneity. The formulation is extended to account for rainfall-induced recharge over a dual-zone unconfined aquifer. In each case, the computed head profiles agree well with numerical counterparts from finite element method.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Onset dynamics of air-water menisci on rock fracture surfaces</paper_heading>
	<author>B.B. Horodecky, E. Perfect, H.Z. Bilheux, J.W. Brabazon, C.H. Gates</author>
	<abstract>Information on menisci dynamics and equilibrium contact angles, θe, is needed for modeling multiphase flow of fluids in geologic formations. The wettability of fracture faces is relevant to applications such as waterflooding in enhanced oil recovery and evaluation of caprock integrity for geologic carbon sequestration. We investigated the vertical capillary rise of air-water menisci on exposed fracture faces for a sandstone, a shale, and three granites. The experimental design approximated that employed in the Wilhelmy plate method. Replicate fracture faces were prepared by fracturing cylindrical rock cores using the Brazilian method and splitting the fractured cores apart along their fracture planes. Meniscus onset was imaged from a cross-sectional perspective using dynamic neutron radiography, and quantified with change point analysis. An existing model for meniscus onset fitted the experimental data very well (median R2 = 0.96). Capillary rise was typified by  scaling (where t is time), followed by a constant equilibrium height, ze. The average time taken for the menisci to reach ze was 0.39 s, with no differences between rock types. The menisci achieved a greater vertical extent on the fracture faces of the sedimentary rocks as compared to those of the granites. Apparent θe values were calculated from the best fit estimates of ze using the Wilhelmy plate equation for a smooth and planar vertical surface. Despite the fractal roughness of some of the fracture faces, there was a significant linear relationship (R2 = 0.80) between the apparent θe values and intrinsic θe values measured on polished surfaces of the same rocks using the sessile drop method. The regression equation indicated the apparent θe values were consistently greater than the intrinsic values. This overestimation may be due to averaging of pixels at the air-water-solid interface, a required step in the image analysis. Further exploration of the range of applicability and measurement accuracy of this proposed new technique would be valuable.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Numerical investigation of solitary wave attenuation and resistance induced by rigid vegetation based on a 3-D RANS model</paper_heading>
	<author>Yanxu Wang, Zegao Yin, Yong Liu</author>
	<abstract>Mangrove forests can significantly attenuate tsunami waves and thus play an important role in coastal protection. As a first approximation, the problem is modeled utilizing solitary waves impinging on emergent/submerged rigid cylinders. A three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model using cyclic boundary conditions was developed based on the IHFOAM solver to investigate the effects of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on the solitary wave attenuation. The numerical model was established based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations combined with the standard k – ω shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model and the volume of fluid (VOF) surface capturing schemes. The results indicate that different patterns are found in terms of flow field characteristics (velocity and turbulent kinetic energy) and forces exerted on the cylinders for various wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration, which helps to better understand wave dissipation mechanism induced by vegetation. Different from the bulk drag coefficient derived by the conventional wave dissipation models, the direct force method was applied to quantify the time-varying and period-averaged drag coefficients (CD) of individual cylinders. The time-varying CD associated with maximum force and local velocity is defined as the representative CD, for comparison with the period-averaged CD in detail. Besides, by considering the submergence ratio, new generic CD formulas are proposed as functions of the modified Reynolds number (Re) and Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC) for illustrating the CD dynamics under solitary wave conditions. Finally, a preliminary comparison between the proposed CD formulas and existing formulas are given to reveal the intrinsic CD law, which may lead to improved understanding and modeling concerning wave-vegetation interaction.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Swash zone morphodynamic modelling including sediment entrained by bore-generated turbulence</paper_heading>
	<author>Fangfang Zhu, Nicholas Dodd</author>
	<abstract>In this paper we introduce a mathematical model of sediment entrainment due to bore-generated turbulence in a shallow water context. In this model, the entrainment is assumed to be proportional to the energy decay rate across a bore on a mobile bed. The energy decay rate across a bore on a mobile bed is derived analytically. This model is incorporated into the one dimensional morphodynamic model developed by Zhu and Dodd (2015), which includes bed- and suspended load transport. This results in new shock conditions, which allow for sediment entrainment at a shock. With it we investigate the effects of sediment entrainment due to bore-generated turbulence on beachface evolution under a single swash event driven by a solitary wave. The simulation results imply that sediment entrainment by bore turbulence at the incoming bore dominates over sediment mobilisation by bed shear stress. In contrast, the backwash bore is dominated by bed shear stress related processes. The morphodynamic impact of bore turbulence on this swash event is primarily erosion of the sea bed seaward of the initial shoreline. Any sediment remaining in the water column seaward of this point is then available to be transported by subsequent events. It is shown that the bed step is primarily a bed load related feature, with sediment entrained as suspended load counteracting the bed step growth.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Enhanced and non-monotonic effective kinetics of solute pulses under michaelis–Menten reactions</paper_heading>
	<author>Antoine Hubert, Tomás Aquino, Hervé Tabuteau, Yves Méheust, Tanguy Le Borgne</author>
	<abstract>Michaelis–Menten kinetics describe a broad range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Since they are non-linear, spatial averaging of reaction kinetics is non-trivial, and it is not known how concentration gradients affect the global effective kinetics. Here, we use numerical simulations and theoretical developments to investigate the effective kinetics of diffusing solute pulses locally subject to Michaelis–Menten reaction kinetics. We find that coupled diffusion and reaction lead to non-monotonic effective kinetics that differ significantly from the local kinetics. The resulting effective reaction rates can be significantly enhanced compared to those of homogeneous batch reactors. We uncover the different regimes of effective kinetics as a function of the Damköhler number and Michaelis–Menten parameters and derive a theory that explains and quantifies these upscaled kinetics using a weakly-coupled description of reaction and diffusion. We illustrate the consequences of these findings on the accelerated consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria. These results are relevant to a large spectrum of reactive systems characterized by heterogeneous concentration landscapes.

	<paper_heading>Deriving representative reservoir operation rules using a hidden Markov-decision tree model</paper_heading>
	<author>Qiankun Zhao, Ximing Cai</author>
	<abstract>Reservoirs have been widely used to regulate streamflow to meet both human and natural water requirements. This study applies a hidden Markov-decision tree (HM-DT) model to derive representative reservoir operation modules under various operation conditions (i.e., inflow, storage, as well as unknown factors) and their transitions (the dynamic change of operation rules) that reflect the impacts of seasonality, long-term non-stationarity, and extreme events on reservoir operation. The representative operation modules can be applied to reservoirs in the same region that are not observed; the capability for simulating dynamic operation behaviors improves the predictive accuracy as compared to regular decision trees. Using a number of reservoirs located in the same region for training, the HM-DT model can derive a limited number of representative operation modules in the form of decision trees (DT), and the transitions between different operation schemes in response to changing operation conditions. The application of the HM-DT model is demonstrated through a case study of the Upper Colorado River basin, where eight representative operation modules are determined for 50 reservoirs located in the region, and the modules are validated with 11 reservoirs in the same region. The eight operation modules are classified into three types (i.e. nearly constant release, release as a piece-wise function of inflow, and release almost identical to inflow). The identified operation modules and the transition patterns between operation modules can be used to better understand real-world operation behaviors, improve future operations, and build realistic reservoir operation components in basin-scale hydrological models.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Inferring geostatistical properties of hydraulic conductivity fields from saline tracer tests and equivalent electrical conductivity time-series</paper_heading>
	<author>Alejandro Fernandez Visentini, Niklas Linde, Tanguy Le Borgne, Marco Dentz</author>
	<abstract>We use Approximate Bayesian Computation and the Kullback–Leibler divergence measure to quantify to what extent horizontal and vertical equivalent electrical conductivity time-series observed during tracer tests constrain the 2-D geostatistical parameters of multivariate Gaussian log-hydraulic conductivity fields. Considering a perfect and known relationship between salinity and electrical conductivity at the point scale, we find that the horizontal equivalent electrical conductivity time-series best constrain the geostatistical properties. The variance, controlling the spreading rate of the solute, is the best constrained geostatistical parameter, followed by the integral scales in the vertical direction. We find that horizontally layered models with moderate to high variance have the best resolved parameters. Since the salinity field at the averaging scale (e.g., the model resolution in tomograms) is typically non-ergodic, our results serve as a starting point for quantifying uncertainty due to small-scale heterogeneity in laboratory-experiments, tomographic results and hydrogeophysical inversions involving DC data.

	<paper_heading>Regional frequency analysis of extreme precipitation based on a nonstationary population index flood method</paper_heading>
	<author>Hanbeen Kim, Ju-Young Shin, Taereem Kim, Sunghun Kim, Jun-Haeng Heo</author>
	<abstract>Anthropogenic climate change has led to nonstationarity in hydrological data and their statistical characteristics. To consider nonstationarity in regional frequency analysis, several nonstationary index flood (NS-IF) methods comprising a time-dependent site-specific scaling factor or nonstationary regional growth curves have been suggested. However, these methods have limitations related to underestimation from using sample statistics as a site-specific scaling factor or considering nonstationarity only in regional parameters. To overcome these drawbacks, this study developed a nonstationary population index flood (NS-PIF) method that considers nonstationarity in the statistical characteristics at each site in a region based on nonstationary generalized extreme value distributions. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for synthetic regions under various nonstationary conditions to compare the performance of the NS-PIF method with those of existing NS-IF methods. Then the applicability of the NS-PIF method to real-world data was assessed via Monte Carlo simulations of regions with annual maximum rainfall data in South Korea. The results indicated that the NS-PIF method can solve the underestimation problem inherent in existing NS-IF methods. Moreover, the NS-PIF method yielded the best performance and provided more reliable and reasonable quantile estimates considering site-specific trends. In addition, the heterogeneity measure based on L-skewness and L-kurtosis was identified as a suitable test of homogeneity for application of the proposed method.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Robust and efficient 3-D numerical model for the hydrodynamic simulation of tsunami wave on land</paper_heading>
	<author>Wei Chek Moon, How Tion Puay, Tze Liang Lau</author>
	<abstract>This study presents the development, refinement, and application of a 3-D multiphase flow model for the simulation of tsunami propagation on land and its hydrodynamic force on a coastal building. The model is based on the Volume/Surface Integrated Average-based Multi-Moment Method (VSIAM3) with improved accuracy by adopting the temporary moment (TM) method to update the non-normal flow variables. A third-order gradient approximation is chosen for the reconstruction of an interpolation profile in the CIP-CLS3 advection solver to further reduce numerical diffusion and suppress numerical oscillation. The moving interface between air–water is captured by using the volume of fluid (VOF) method. The Tangent of Hyperbola for Interface Capturing (THINC) scheme is used to reproduce a sharp and smear-less air–water interface. The model performance improved by as much as 16% in the estimation of impact force on the downstream wall in the dam-break flow benchmarking problem by refining the original VSIAM3 model. The robustness of the model is further demonstrated by the accurate reproduction of tsunami wave propagation speed and its hydrodynamic pressures on a single box-shaped obstacle. The wave-induced pressures on the front face of the obstacle are accurately reproduced, with a maximum of 10% difference compared with the hydraulic experimental results. Thus, the study shows that the overall robustness and hydrodynamic performance of the model can be improved by refining the original model.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Experimental and numerical upscaling of foam flow in highly permeable porous media</paper_heading>
	<author>Sagyn Omirbekov, Hossein Davarzani, Stéfan Colombano, Azita Ahmadi-Senichault</author>
	<abstract>Foam in porous media has been studied as a tool for various applications. Recently, the technology has become relevant for contaminated-aquifer remediation, where porous media are highly permeable. Therefore, the behavior of foam flow in high permeability porous media still raises numerous questions. In particular, upscaling of the foam flow from pore to Darcy scale is still under debate. Since the behavior of bulk foam has been studied principally in the food and cosmetics industries, and foam flow in porous media has mainly been investigated in the oil industry, the link between bulk-foam behavior and foam flow in porous media is still missing. The upscaling of foam flow from the pore scale to the laboratory scale could give valuable insight for understanding foam flow in aquifers. We studied the behavior of pre-generated foam with different foam qualities through the rheological characterization of bulk foam using a rheometer and also when flowing in a porous medium composed of 1 mm glass beads. Foam was formed by co-injecting surfactant solution and nitrogen gas through a porous column filled by fine sand. The homogenization method is used to study macroscopic foam flow properties in porous media by solving the non-linear boundary value problem. The rheology of bulk foam is then used as an input in the upscaling procedure for foam flow in different periodic model 2D and 3D unit cells. From our experiments, we found that the bulk foam is a yield-stress fluid and that the yield-stress values increase with foam quality. Moreover, the rheology of bulk foam corresponds well to the yield stress (Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou) model. We found that foam behaves as a continuous yield-stress fluid in highly permeable porous media. It was also shown that the apparent foam viscosity in porous media increases with the foam quality at the same total flow rate. The results obtained from the rheometer successfully match the outcomes of apparent foam viscosity obtained by flow in porous media by a shifting parameter for the same foam quality. The apparent foam viscosity found in 1 mm glass-bead packing was much higher than bulk foam viscosity. Experimental results were compared to numerical results on simple unit cells. Although we observed considerable differences between the experimental and numerical results of upscaling, the general trend was identical. The differences can be explained by the complexity of the foam flow in porous media, especially foam compressibility. We found that foam flow at low capillary numbers is influenced by the trapping effect and at high pressure gradients by the compressibility. Compressibility was estimated for foam flow in 1 mm glass-bead packing. When foam compressibility is insignificant, the upscaling model can predict foam-flow behavior well at the Darcy scale.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils: General effective medium theory</paper_heading>
	<author>Mahyar Naseri, Andre Peters, Wolfgang Durner, Sascha C. Iden</author>
	<abstract>Despite a longstanding interest in understanding the effects of rock fragments on soil hydraulic properties, physically-based models to describe the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils are still rare. The conductivity of stony soils is mostly described by simple scaling approaches, assuming impermeable rock fragments. We present a model based on the general effective medium (GEM) theory to calculate the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils. The model accounts for the volumetric content, shape, and orientation of rock fragments in the main direction of water flow. Rock fragments can either be permeable or impermeable in the model which allows to calculate the effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils over the full range of soil matric potentials. Existing models assume rock fragments to be isolated and their application is therefore limited to low to moderately stony soils. In GEM model interaction between rock fragments is allowed, which makes it applicable in stony soils with high contents of rock fragments. The mathematical simplicity of the model makes it suitable for practical applications and provides a strong theoretical basis for improving predictions of flow and transport in hydrological models applied in forested and agricultural watersheds and mountainous areas.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>The role of the spatial heterogeneity and correlation length of surface wettability on two-phase flow in a CO2-water-rock system</paper_heading>
	<author>Ruichang Guo, Laura E. Dalton, Ming Fan, James McClure, ... Cheng Chen</author>
	<abstract>This study characterized and modeled heterogeneous surface wettability in sandstone and investigated the role of spatial heterogeneity and correlation length of surface wettability on relative permeability in a supercritical CO2 (scCO2)-brine-rock system. Understanding the role of wettability heterogeneity on relative permeability is essential to geological CO2 sequestration, oil and gas recovery, and contaminated groundwater remediation. Although numerous studies have attempted to understand the influences of surface wettability, capillary number (Ca), and viscosity ratio, the role of the spatial variation and correlation length of surface wettability on two-phase flow in three-dimensional (3D) porous media has not been unraveled due to the challenges in the measurement and representation of realistic rock surface wettability. In this work, we conducted in-situ measurements of surface contact angle (CA) in a Bentheimer sandstone after CO2 flooding using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and found that the pore-scale CA distribution on rock surfaces followed a log-normal distribution associated with a spatial correlation length. Based on the statistical information from CT scanning, a Gaussian random field was used to model CA distributions that had desired standard deviations and spatial correlation lengths, which were then adjusted within a certain range of values for sensitivity analyses to study their combined effects on the two-phase flow in the porous medium using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. The LB two-phase flow simulation was accelerated using hybrid, multicore parallel computing to overcome the challenges in simulating multiphase flow in a large 3D domain having 800 × 800 × 600 nodes. The simulation results showed that the surface wettability heterogeneity (i.e., standard deviation of CA) had a lesser effect on the relative permeability of the wetting fluid (water) but a more significant impact on the relative permeability of the non-wetting fluid (scCO2). The Corey model was used to fit the LB-simulated relative permeability curves of water and scCO2 and showed that the variations in the relative permeability curves for both water and scCO2 increased as the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of CA increased. This study illustrated that the assumption of homogeneous surface wettability may cause errors in multiphase flow simulations. The impacts of both the standard deviation and spatial correlation length of CAs should be accounted for. This is the first study that explored the spatial correlation lengths associated with CA distributions on sandstone surfaces and comprehensively investigated the roles of both spatial variation and correlation length of CA on two-phase flow properties in 3D porous media. The optimized LB multiphase flow model was proved a powerful tool to study the interplays and combined effects of these statistical parameters, which had critical applications in numerous natural and engineering processes that involved multiphase flow in porous media.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A primer on information processing in upscaling</paper_heading>
	<author>Brian D. Wood, Ehsan Taghizadeh</author>
	<abstract>The intent of this paper is to provide both an introduction to the concepts of information theory, and to review how such concepts might be effectively applied in computing information reduction via upscaling methods. The concept of using scaling postulates to reduce the dimensionality or amount of information in a problem is a central idea in upscaling. In this paper, we present a number of introductory examples that help illustrate the fundamental concepts and definitions of information theory. While the subject matter relates primarily to applications from hydrologic systems, the concepts are general and may be applied to upscaling in any physical system. Two more involved examples are investigated. The first examines how information content is changed by upscaling for the observable volume fraction in a heterogeneous porous material with a binary distribution of textures. In this example, we also focus on how the entropy of the data changes with increasing sample size, and how the sample size relates to the distribution of the observed volume fraction. The notion of typical sets from information theory is introduced, and a connection between this concept and the concept of a representative (elementary) volume (REV or RV) is made. In a second example, we examine similar issues related to information content, sample size, upscaling, and the distribution of the upscaled variables. To add additional concreteness to the example, we also introduce the idea of a simple utility function as a constraint for discerning among different upscaling options. This latter concept is important when the relative costs of upscaling (i.e., the loss of resolution) must be weighted against the benefits (reduction in the number of degrees of freedom). Such analyses may be important when considering upscaling options (model selection) in applications.

	<author>Wanying Liu, Qingzhi Hou, Jijian Lian, Anmin Zhang, Jianwu Dang</author>
	<abstract>The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used in this paper to simulate the transport process of coastal pollutant by solving the two-dimensional (2D) depth averaged advection-diffusion equation in Lagrangian framework. To avoid directly discretizing the second-order derivatives, the diffusion terms are decomposed into two first-order derivatives by introducing the diffusive flux. To verify the proposed Lagrangian particle model, numerical experiments on four typical tests are performed, including the discontinuity, pure advection, grid anisotropy and large deforming flow. The high-resolution Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) scheme - the modified TVD Lax–Friedrichs method with Superbee limiter (MTVDLF-Superbee) - is also implemented for detailed comparison. The simulation results indicated that the present SPH-based model has better performance than MTVDLF-Superbee. In addition, the stability, convergence and efficiency of the proposed model are numerically analyzed. The Lagrangian particle model with diffusive flux gives satisfactory results with big time step and hence allows large Courant number, guaranteeing the computational efficiency.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Effective dispersion coefficients for the upscaling of pore-scale mixing and reaction</paper_heading>
	<author>Alexandre Puyguiraud, Lazaro J. Perez, Juan J. Hidalgo, Marco Dentz</author>
	<abstract>We upscale reactive mixing using effective dispersion coefficients to capture the combined effect of pore-scale heterogeneity and molecular diffusion on the evolution of the mixing interface between two initially segregated dissolved species. Effective dispersion coefficients are defined in terms of the average spatial variance of the solute distribution evolving from a pointlike injection, that is, the transport Green function. We numerically investigate the temporal behavior of the longitudinal effective dispersion coefficients for two porous media of different pore-scale heterogeneity as measured by the statistics of the flow speed, and different Péclet numbers. We find that the effective dispersion coefficients evolve with time, or equivalently travel distance. As the solute samples the pore-scale flow heterogeneity due to advection and transverse diffusion, the effective dispersion coefficients evolve from the value of molecular diffusion to the corresponding hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients. Thus, at times smaller than the diffusion time over a characteristic pore length, the effective dispersion coefficients can be significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients. This difference can explain frequently observed mismatches between pore-scale reactive mixing data, and predictions using Darcy scale transport descriptions based on hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients that are constant in time. This suggests that the notion of incomplete mixing on the support scale can be quantified in terms of effective pore-scale dispersion coefficients. We use effective dispersion in order to approximate the transport Green function in terms of a Gaussian-shaped distribution that is characterized by the effective variance. This is approximation is termed dispersive lamella. Based on this representation, we study reactive mixing between two initially segregated solutes. The dispersive lamella approach accurately predicts the evolution of the product mass of an instantaneous bimolecular reaction obtained from direct numerical simulations. This demonstrates that effective dispersion is an accurate measure for width of the mixing interface between the two reacting species. These results shed some new light on pore-scale mixing, the notion of incomplete mixing, and its prediction and upscaling in terms of an effective mixing model.</abstract>

	<author>Arash Rabbani, Masoud Babaei, Reza Shams, Ying Da Wang, Traiwit Chung</author>
	<abstract>DeePore2 is a deep learning workflow for rapid estimation of a wide range of porous material properties based on the binarized micro–tomography images. By combining naturally occurring porous textures we generated 17,700 semi–real 3–D micro–structures of porous geo–materials with size of 2563 voxels and 30 physical properties of each sample are calculated using physical simulations on the corresponding pore network models. Next, a designed feed–forward convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained based on the dataset to estimate several morphological, hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical characteristics of the porous material in a fraction of a second. In order to fine–tune the CNN design, we tested 9 different training scenarios and selected the one with the highest average coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.885 for 1418 testing samples. Additionally, 3 independent synthetic images as well as 3 realistic tomography images have been tested using the proposed method and results are compared with pore network modelling and experimental data, respectively. Tested absolute permeabilities had around 13% relative error compared to the experimental data which is noticeable considering the accuracy of the direct numerical simulation methods such as Lattice Boltzmann and Finite Volume. The workflow is compatible with any physical size of the images due to its dimensionless approach and can be used to characterize large–scale 3–D images by averaging the model outputs for a sliding window that scans the whole geometry.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Characterization and upscaling of hydrodynamic transport in heterogeneous dual porosity media</paper_heading>
	<author>Philippe Gouze, Alexandre Puyguiraud, Delphine Roubinet, Marco Dentz</author>
	<abstract>We study the upscaling of pore-scale transport of passive solute in a carbonate rock sample. It is characterized by microporous regions displaying heterogeneous porosity distribution that are accessible due to diffusion only, and a strongly heterogeneous mobile pore space, characterized by a broad distribution of flow velocities. We observe breakthrough curves that are characterized by strong tailing, which can be attributed to velocity variability in the flowing medium portion, and solute retention in the microporous space. Using accurate numerical flow and transport simulations, we separate these two mechanisms by analyzing the statistics of residence times in the mobile phase, and the trapping and residence time statistics in the mmobile phase. We employ a continuous time random walk framework in order to upscale transport using a particle based implementation of mobile-immobile mass transfer, and heterogeneous advection. This approach is based on the statistics of the characteristic mobile and immobile residence times, and mass transfer rates between the two continua. While classical mobile-immobile approaches model mass transfer as a constant rate process, we find that the trapping rate increases with increasing mobile residence times until it reaches a constant asymptotic value. Based on these findings and the statistical characteristics of travel and retention times, we derive an upscaled Lagrangian transport model that separates the processes of heterogeneous advection and diffusion in the immobile microporous space, and provides accurate descriptions of the observed non-Fickian breakthrough curves. These results shed light on transport upscaling in highly complex dual-porosity rocks for which mobile-immobile mass transfer are controlled by a dual multirate process controlled by the heterogeneity of both the flow field in the connected porosity and the diffusion in the no-flow regions.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Flood risk forecasting at weather to medium range incorporating weather model, topography, socio-economic information and land use exposure</paper_heading>
	<author>Shrabani S. Tripathy, Hari Vittal, Subhankar Karmakar, Subimal Ghosh</author>
	<abstract>Non-structural mitigation measures to the globally increasing flood events include forecast based alert generation. However, the extreme rainfall forecasts are associated with low hit rate, high false alarm, and spatiotemporal bias; which makes it difficult to rely on them. Further, the losses due to flood in a region not only depend on rainfall severity but also on topography, socioeconomic conditions and exposure of the region to floods. Here, we introduce a new concept of spatial flood risk mapping and forecasting at weather to medium range based on forecasted hazard, embedded with vulnerability (topographic and socioeconomic) and exposure information. We define hazard as the probability of extreme rainfall event during upcoming days given an available weather forecast for the same days. As hindcast is used for computation of probabilities, hazard contains prior information about the false alarm, hit rate and spatiotemporal bias of the forecast. Vulnerability is calculated by averaging the topographic and socioeconomic indicators, and exposure is calculated using a land use land cover map. Topographic vulnerability is computed with digital elevation model using Height Above the Nearest Drainage method, and Data Envelopment Analysis is performed to derive the socioeconomic vulnerability based on the demographic census data. For a specific region and a specific event, the relative flood risk maps are generated at an administrative level (e.g., district, subdistrict or village level for India) and the high-risk areas can be identified from those maps for mitigation. The methodology is demonstrated for a very recent extremely severe flood event that happened in Kerala, India in August 2018. It is evident from the results that the high-risk areas forecasted well in advance (as high lead time as 15 days) match fairly well with the areas, which suffered maximum losses because of direct flood.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Experimental study of the temperature effect on two-phase flow properties in highly permeable porous media: Application to the remediation of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in polluted soil</paper_heading>
	<author>Nicolas Philippe, Hossein Davarzani, Stéfan Colombano, Malorie Dierick, ... Manuel Marcoux</author>
	<abstract>The remediation of aquifers contaminated by viscous dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) is a challenging problem. Coal tars are the most abundant persistent DNAPLs due to their high viscosity and complexity. Pumping processes leave considerable volume fractions of DNAPLs in the soil and demand high operational costs to reach cleaning objectives. Thermally enhanced recovery focuses on decreasing DNAPL viscosity to reduce residual saturation. The oil industry has previously applied this technique with great success for enhanced oil recovery applications. However, in soil remediation, high porous media permeabilities and product densities may invalidate those techniques. Additionally, the impacts of temperature on coal tar's physical properties have not been thoroughly discussed in available literature. Here, we investigated how coal tar's physical properties, the capillary pressure-saturation curve and the relative permeability of two-phase flow in porous media depend on the temperature and flow rate experimentally. Drainage and imbibition experiments under quasi-static (steady-state) and dynamic (unsteady-state) conditions have been carried out at 293.15 K and 323.15 K in a 1D small cell filled with 1 mm homogeneous glass beads. Two different pairs of immiscible fluids have been investigated, coal tar-water and canola oil-ethanol. Results demonstrated similar trends for temperature effect and values of fluid properties for both liquid pairs, which backs up the use of canola oil-ethanol to model coal tar-water flow. It was found that there is no temperature effect on drainage-imbibition curves or residual saturation under quasi-static conditions. In dynamic conditions, the DNAPL residual saturation decreased by 16 % when the temperature changed from 293.15 K to 323.15 K. This drop was mainly linked to decreasing viscous fingering, as well as the appearance of wetting phase films around the glass beads. Both phenomena have been observed only in dynamic experiments. A high enough pumping flow rate is needed to generate dynamic effects in the porous medium. Ethanol and oil's relative permeabilities also increase with temperature under dynamic measurement conditions. Our findings indicate that flow rate is an important parameter to consider in thermal enhanced recovery processes. These effects are not taken into account in the classically used generalized Darcy's law for modeling two-phase flow in porous media with temperature variation.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Pore-scale imaging with measurement of relative permeability and capillary pressure on the same reservoir sandstone sample under water-wet and mixed-wet conditions</paper_heading>
	<author>Ying Gao, Ali Q. Raeini, Ahmed M. Selem, Igor Bondino, ... Branko Bijeljic</author>
	<abstract>Using micro-CT imaging and differential pressure measurements, we design a comparative study in which we simultaneously measure relative permeability and capillary pressure on the same reservoir sandstone sample under water-wet and mixed-wet conditions during steady-state waterflooding experiments. This allows us to isolate the impact of wettability on a pore-by-pore basis and its effect on the macroscopic parameters, capillary pressure and relative permeability, while keeping the pore-space geometry unchanged. First, oil and brine were injected through a water-wet reservoir sandstone sample at a fixed total flow rate, but in a sequence of increasing brine fractional flows with micro-CT scans of the fluid phases taken in each step. Then the sample was brought back to initial water saturation and the surface wettability of the sample was altered after prolonged contact with crude oil and the same measurement procedure was repeated on the altered-wettability sample which we call mixed-wet. Geometric contact angles were measured, which discriminated the water-wet and mixed-wet cases with average values of 75° and 89° respectively. Additionally, an energy balance was used to determine the effective contact angles for displacement which indicated that a higher advancing contact angle of 116° was needed to displace oil in the mixed-wet case. For the water-wet experiment the filling sequence was pore-size dependent, with a strong correlation between pore size and oil occupancy. However, in the mixed-wet experiment the principal determinant of the filling sequence was the wettability rather than the pore size, and there was no correlation between pore size and the residual oil occupancy. The oil-water interfacial area had a larger maximum in the mixed-wet case which was supported by the observation of sheet or saddle-like menisci shapes present throughout the sample volume that impede the flow. These shapes were quantified by much larger negative Gaussian curvature which indicated better connectivity of the phases, consistent with the lower residual oil saturation. Mean curvature and associated capillary pressure were positive for the water-wet case but decreased to a negative value for the mixed-wet case pointing to forced displacement from oil-wet pores. This analysis explained why the relative permeabilities for the mixed-wet case were lower than for the water-wet case for the same fractional flow.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Characterization of the micro-scale surface roughness effect on immiscible fluids and interfacial areas in porous media using the measurements of interfacial partitioning tracer tests</paper_heading>
	<author>Hao Jiang, Bo Guo, Mark L. Brusseau</author>
	<abstract>This study presents a model-based methodology to characterize the surface roughness effect on immiscible fluids in porous media using the measurements obtained with the gas-phase interfacial partitioning tracer test (IPTT). The characterization approach captures how adsorbed wetting film configuration on grain surfaces influences fluid-fluid interfaces in unsaturated porous media. The method establishes a novel representation of surface and interface roughness that delineates the micro-scale fractal nature of grain surfaces and the fluid-surface interactions at these scales. The method was tested using reported experimental data for several soils. The results showed that the methodology was effective for natural porous media comprising a range of physical and geochemical properties. Comparisons between characterized parameters of different media revealed that micro-scale surface roughness was only partially correlated to soil texture properties. Images of the test media obtained with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrates the complexity of micro-scale surface roughness, and its variability among different media. Tests with an organic liquid–water system validated the generalness of surface roughness properties generated by the model. The proposed methodology is anticipated to provide a means to characterize and quantify the effects of surface roughness on fluid-solid interaction and fluid-fluid interfacial area, which are critical to various environmental disciplines.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Wettability alteration implications on pore-scale multiphase flow in porous media using the lattice Boltzmann method</paper_heading>
	<author>Mohamed N. Nemer, Parthib R. Rao, Laura Schaefer</author>
	<abstract>Multiphase flow in porous media is found in a variety of engineering problems, including in technologies focused on satisfying the energy needs of an expanding global population while minimizing the effects of human activity on climate change. The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the importance and interdependence of the wettability-altered fraction, the degree of wettability alteration, and the spatially-varying contact angle assignment in influencing the pore-scale and macroscale flow properties. In order to conduct this investigation and analyze the effects on the relative permeability curves and fluid configurations, the Shan-Chen multi-relaxation-time multicomponent lattice Boltzmann model with explicit forcing is utilized, and domains of increasing fractions of wettability-altered pores are generated. We find that the fraction altered, the degree of alteration, and the accurate contact angle assignment are all correlated, and play a role to varying extents in influencing the flow behavior and the resulting relative permeability curves. The fraction altered displays the strongest effect, and the effects of the degree of alteration and contact angle assignment become more significant when a larger fraction of the sample has undergone wettability alteration. A sample that has undergone fractional wettability alteration results in a larger resistance to the overall flow and more tortuous flow paths, at intermediate saturations, in comparison to a strongly water/oil wetting domain. In a high porosity domain that is becoming increasingly oil-wet, the degree of wettability alteration has a more pronounced effect on the flow behavior of the oil phase, whereas the flow of the water phase remains dictated by the large pore spaces and the regions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration until a significant fraction of the domain has been altered. Moreover, a spatially-varying contact angle assignment becomes more important for a system with a large distribution of contact angles. The results demonstrate the correlations between wettability alteration and pore geometry and highlight the need for an algorithm that captures the true time-dependent wettability state of a porous medium sample.

	<paper_heading>Transport of zinc ions in the hyporheic zone: Experiments and simulations</paper_heading>
	<author>Guangqiu Jin, Zhongtian Zhang, Ruzhong Li, Chen Chen, ... D.A. Barry</author>
	<abstract>Large amounts of toxic metals are discharged into rivers and lakes, but little is known about the factors that drive the adsorption and transformation of these metals in the hyporheic zone and the exchange flux across the sediment-water interface. To better understand transport and transformation of metal ions in the hyporheic zone, flume experiments and numerical simulations were performed in a streambed with periodic bedforms using zinc ions. Compared to non-adsorbing contaminant, the results show that adsorption leads to a more rapid decrease in the concentration of Zn2+ in the overlying water, and a lower final concentration is reached. The mass of adsorbed ions is several times higher than that of free ions in the bedform's water phase. Indeed, metal adsorption is in the shallow layer of the streambed. Although this prevents heavy metal groundwater contamination, the same cannot be said of shallow layer of the hyporheic zone. Knowledge of the migration and transformation of metal ions in the hyporheic zone provides insights pertinent to the restoration of polluted rivers.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Homogenization approach to the upscaling of a reactive flow through particulate filters with wall integrated catalyst</paper_heading>
	<author>Oleg Iliev, Andro Mikelić, Torben Prill, Arsha Sherly</author>
	<abstract>Catalytic membranes can degrade gaseous pollutants to clean gas via a catalytic reaction to achieve green emissions. Further, a catalytic membrane is a three scale porous medium. Membranes used in catalytic filters usually have thicknesses of centimeters or millimeters, and consist of active (washcoat) particles, inert material and microscale, micron size, pores. The washcoat particles are porous material with nanoscale pores. The catalytic reactions are heterogeneous (surface reactions) and they occur on the surface of the nanopores. Obviously, simulations at fully resolved pore scale are not feasible, and upscaling techniques have to be applied. It is known that the same microscale problem can be upscaled to different macroscale equations depending on the characteristic numbers. In this paper we study the homogenization of reactive flow in the presence of strong absorption in the washcoat particles. Two reactive transport regimes are studied, where in both the reaction dominates over the convection and the diffusion. Péclet’s number in the first one is of order 1, and in the second one it is proportional to the ratio of the thickness of the catalytic membrane and the characteristic length of the microscale pores. Two different upscaled equations are obtained, respectively. Direct numerical simulation at microscale is used to validate these derived macroscale equations.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Improvement of remeshed Lagrangian methods for the simulation of dissolution processes at pore-scale</paper_heading>
	<author>Jean-Matthieu Etancelin, Peter Moonen, Philippe Poncet</author>
	<abstract>This article shows how to consistently and accurately manage the Lagrangian formulation of chemical reaction equations coupled with the superficial velocity formalism introduced in the late 80s by Quintard and Whitaker. Lagrangian methods prove very helpful in problems in which transport effects are strong or dominant, but they need to be periodically put back in a regular lattice, a process called remeshing. In the context of digital rock physics, we need to ensure positive concentrations and regularity to accurately handle stagnation point neighborhoods. These two conditions lead to the use of kernels resulting in extra-diffusion, which can be prohibitively high when the diffusion coefficient is small. This is the case especially for reactive porous media, and the phenomenon is reinforced in porous rock matrices due to Archie’s law. This article shows how to overcome this difficulty in the context of a two-scale porosity model applied in the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes equations, and how to obtain simultaneous sign preservation, regularity and accurate diffusion, and apply it to dissolution processes at the pore scale of actual rocks.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Influence of the spatial and temporal monitoring design on the identification of an instantaneous pollutant release in a river</paper_heading>
	<author>Stephanie Zeunert, Günter Meon</author>
	<abstract>In recent years, several approaches in the field of pollution source identification have been developed to identify the unknown pollution source parameters (PSP) of a river pollution incident. These approaches rely on monitoring data which have to be collected in the case of the pollution incident. Up until now, the influence of the often arbitrarily selected monitoring data on the identification results is rarely evaluated. Nevertheless, when considering an inverse problem, monitoring data can be of major importance regarding parameter identifiability and the reliable estimation of unknown parameters. Accordingly, in this work, the influence of the spatial and temporal monitoring design on the identification of an instantaneous pollutant release is analyzed. Assuming steady flow conditions, an analytical solution of the two-dimensional advection-dispersion-reaction-equation is used to model the pollutant transport in the river. The mirror-image technique is applied to capture no-flux conditions across the lateral boundaries. Parameter identifiability is analyzed using the profile likelihood approach. The approach additionally enables the user to determine causes in the case of poor or non-identifiability and to derive likelihood-based confidence intervals. The results imply that the spatial and temporal monitoring design has a significant influence on the identifiability and reliable estimation of PSP. This work provides an overview of first recommendations to guide the setup of a monitoring campaign in the case of a pollution incident.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>PIV study of flow through and over porous media at the onset of inertia</paper_heading>
	<author>J.K. Arthur</author>
	<abstract>In this paper, laminar flow through and over models of porous media is studied to characterize the flow at the onset of inertia. Horizontal, vertical or mesh arrays of circular rods are used to model the porous medium. The rods are arranged to cover solid volume fraction ranging from 0.03 to 0.49, and to fill approximately three-quarters of the depth of the test section. Each of the porous media models is tested in a refractive-index matched viscous fluid flow driven by pressure. The Reynolds number is also varied over an order of magnitude to cover the regime at which the porous medium flow just transitions from a Darcy to an inertia laminar flow regime. Velocity measurements are then obtained by a planar particle image velocimetry technique. The experimental data confirms that the averaged transition flow is indeed governed by the Brinkman equation if modeled with a new parametrization of the apparent viscosity, and modified with an equivalent permeability that accounts for the effects of inertia. Additionally, the results show that at such inertial flows, the interfacial region is the porous medium zone affected most by changes in Reynolds numbers. The data presented in this work provide tools for analytical and numerical validations, and the prediction of interfacial flow pertaining to isotropic porous media.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Determination of the aperture distribution of rough-walled rock fractures with the non-toxic Yield Stress fluids porosimetry method</paper_heading>
	<author>Antonio Rodríguez de Castro, Azita Ahmadi-Sénichault, Abdelaziz Omari</author>
	<abstract>Fractures in geological formations constitute high-conductivity conduits which potentially act as preferential paths during fluid injection in soil remediation and reservoir engineering operations. Recently, the measurement of the pressure drop under different flow rates during the flow of yield stress fluids in porous media has been proposed as the basis for an environmentally friendly method to characterize the Pore Size Distribution. However, the Yield Stress fluids porosimetry Method (YSM) has still not been extended to the characterization of the hydraulic aperture distribution of rough-walled rock fractures. The potential interest of such an extension is intense, considering that the distinct characteristics of rock fractures vs the matrix represent a burden to other traditional porosimetry techniques. In the particular case of X-ray microtomography, time-consuming calibration is often needed, and serious difficulties arise due to beam hardening and reconstruction artifacts. The specific objective of the present investigation is to adapt YSM to the characterization of rough-walled rock fractures. For this purpose, the results of laboratory experiments in which a yield stress fluid was injected through two natural rock fractures were exploited, and the YSM model and algorithm was adapted to the particular topological and geometrical features of flows in fractures. Moreover, numerical experiments were performed at the scale of a single 2D channel with variable aperture to identify the dimension characterized by YSM and decipher the yielding behaviour of the fluids. The present findings show that YSM can be successfully used to characterize the distribution of hydraulic apertures of the flow channels in rough-walled rock fractures. Furthermore, the numerical results revealed that the plug of stagnant fluid is located in the central part of these flow channels and breaks close to the constrictions, forming islands of unyielded fluid.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Upscaled equations for two-phase flow in highly heterogeneous porous media: Varying permeability and porosity</paper_heading>
	<author>Tufan Ghosh, Carina Bringedal, Rainer Helmig, G.P. Raja Sekhar</author>
	<abstract>In this article we consider a two-phase flow model in a highly heterogeneous porous column. The porous column consists of homogeneous blocks, where the porosity and permeability vary from one block to the other. The flow direction is perpendicular to the layering of the porous column, and hence can be approximated by one-dimensional model equations. The periodic change in porosity and absolute permeability enforce the fluid to be trapped at the interface between the blocks, leading to a highly varying saturation. In order to capture the effective behavior, upscaled equations for the average saturation are derived via homogenization. This technique relies on a notion of periodicity and allows averaging over any number of blocks that may have any internal distributions of the rock parameters. Moreover, the present article also derives effective equations for randomly distributed layers of different porosity and absolute permeability. Numerical experiments are performed which show good agreement between the averaged solutions of the original micro-scale equations and the solutions of the upscaled equations, also in the case of randomly distributed layers. In particular these numerical experiments show how the internal distribution of the permeability and porosity affect the effective behavior of the flow.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Direct numerical simulation of trapped-phase recirculation at low capillary number</paper_heading>
	<author>Amir Hossein Mohammadi Alamooti, Qumars Azizi, Hossein Davarzani</author>
	<abstract>Understanding multiphase flow in porous media, especially how velocity is distributed at the pore-scale, has been the aim of several studies. However, these studies address the recirculation behavior inside the trapped phase experimentally without any comprehensive numerical study of the impact of different governing mechanisms related to the fluid configurations and properties, including drag force and capillary number analysis at low capillary number regime. In this study, we analyzed the recirculation phenomenon inside the trapped phase for various displacement mechanisms, fluid configurations, and dynamic properties. To simulate the pore-scale displacement at low capillary number, we used a filtered surface-force formulation of volume of fluid method, which was implemented in a separately available solver for OpenFoam package. The results showed that within the ranges of capillary number of invading phase analyzed in this study (in the order of 1 × 10−7 to 1 × 10−2), the recirculation phenomenon exists in trapped phases. During the imbibition mechanism, two stagnant regions are created adjacent to the fluid-fluid interface inside the invading fluid. Drag-force analysis on fluid-fluid interfaces shows that during imbibition the maximum force is exerted near the center of the interface, whereas during drainage more force is applied on two elongated interface tails on a solid surface. The centroids are elongated parallel to the interface during drainage and perpendicularly during imbibition, which is in concordance with drag-force distribution along with the interface. The existence of a solid surface near the fluid-fluid interface affects the recirculation process in a way that one or more centroids can be created depending on displacement mechanisms. When the ratio of trapped-phase radius to cavity depth is lower, two simultaneous recirculation zones are formed inside the invading and trapped phases While the changes in viscosity ratio and interfacial tension shifted the centroid location inside the trapped zone, the center of rotation seems to be independent of injection velocity. The average velocity of trapped phase is individually a logarithmic function of the surface tension and fluids viscosity ratio. The stationariness of centroid results in a linear relationship between the average velocity inside the trapped zone and injection velocity. For all ranges of viscosity ratios, a linear relationship between the capillary number of invading and trapped phase is obtained. The findings of this study lead to a better understanding of trapping and mobilization mechanisms in microchannels where various forces are acting on fluid-fluid interfaces.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Urban pluvial flooding prediction by machine learning approaches – a case study of Shenzhen city, China</paper_heading>
	<author>Qian Ke, Xin Tian, Jeremy Bricker, Zhan Tian, ... Junguo Liu</author>
	<abstract>Urban pluvial flooding is a threatening natural hazard in urban areas all over the world, especially in recent years given its increasing frequency of occurrence. In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events – especially in the future climate – this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Multivariate remotely sensed and in-situ data assimilation for enhancing community WRF-Hydro model forecasting</paper_heading>
	<author>Peyman Abbaszadeh, Keyhan Gavahi, Hamid Moradkhani</author>
	<abstract>Flood is one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in the United States, particularly in the Southeast states where hurricanes and tropical storms are most prevalent, causing billions of dollars in damage annually and significant losses of life and property. The Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) is a community-based hydrologic model designed to improve the skill of hydrometeorological forecasts, such as river discharge, through simulating hydrologic prognostic (e.g., soil moisture) and diagnostic (e.g., energy fluxes) variables. These quantities are potentially biased or erroneous due to the uncertainties involved in all layers of hydrologic predictions. In this study, we use an ensemble based Data Assimilation (DA) approach to explore the benefit of independently and jointly assimilating remotely sensed SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture (at different spatial resolutions) and USGS streamflow observations to improve the accuracy and reliability of WRF-Hydro model predictions while accounting for uncertainties. This study is conducted over a large region near to Houston, Texas where heavy rainfall from hurricane Harvey caused flooding in 2017. Before implementing DA, we first calibrated the WRF-Hydro model parameters using four United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges installed within the watershed. In this step, we identified the most dominant model parameters, which were used later in the development of joint state-parameter DA. The findings of this study showed that the multivariate assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow observations results in improved prediction of streamflow as compared to univariate assimilation configurations and regardless of the watershed's streamflow regime. The results also revealed that, during the normal streamflow condition, assimilation of downscaled SMAP soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution, would improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation more than the assimilation of coarse resolution products (i.e., the native SMAP at 36 km spatial resolution and its interpolated version at 9 km spatial resolution). However, during the period of hurricane Harvey, the soil moisture observations at different resolutions showed a similar impact on improving the streamflow prediction.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Can modern multi-objective evolutionary algorithms discover high-dimensional financial risk portfolio tradeoffs for snow-dominated water-energy systems?</paper_heading>
	<author>Rohini S. Gupta, Andrew L. Hamilton, Patrick M. Reed, Gregory W. Characklis</author>
	<abstract>Hydropower generation in the Hetch Hetchy Power System is strongly tied to snowmelt dynamics in the central Sierra Nevada and consequently is particularly financially vulnerable to changes in snowpack availability and timing. This study explores the Hetchy Hetchy Power System as a representative example from the broader class of financial risk management problems that hold promise in helping utilities such as SFPUC to understand the tradeoffs across portfolios of risk mitigation instruments given uncertainties in snowmelt dynamics. An evolutionary multi-objective direct policy search (EMODPS) framework is implemented to identify time adaptive stochastic rules that map utility state information and exogenous inputs to optimal annual financial decisions. The resulting financial risk mitigation portfolio planning problem is mathematically difficult due to its high dimensionality and mixture of nonlinear, nonconvex, and discrete objectives. These features add to the difficulty of the problem by yielding a Pareto front of solutions that has a highly disjoint and complex geometry. In this study, we contribute a diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms’ (MOEAs') abilities to support a DPS framework for managing financial risk. We perform comprehensive diagnostics on five algorithms: the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (RVEA), and the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). The MOEAs are evaluated to characterize their controllability (ease-of-use), reliability (probability of success), efficiency (minimizing model evaluations), and effectiveness (high quality tradeoff representations). Our results show that newer decomposition, reference point, and reference vector algorithms are highly sensitive to their parameterizations (difficult to use), suffer from search deterioration (losing solutions), and have a strong likelihood of misrepresenting key tradeoffs. The results emphasize the importance of using MOEAs with archiving and adaptive search capabilities in order to solve complex financial risk portfolio problems in snow-dependent water-energy systems.

A generic L-moment algorithm is devised to fit the distributions, also applicable to distributions without analytical L-moment expressions. The analysis shows: (1) the models perform equally well when describing the observed annual peaks; (2) the right tail appears heavier in the ƁrIII and ƁrXII models leading to larger streamflow predictions when compared to those of ; (3) the  predicts upper streamflow limits in 39.1% of the records—these limits have realistic exceedance probabilities based on the other two models; (4) the tail heaviness estimation seems not robust in the  case when compared to the ƁrIII and ƁrXII models and this could challenge ’s reliability in predicting streamflow at large return periods; and, (5) regional variation is observed in the behaviour of flood peaks across different climatic regions of Canada. The findings of this study reveal potential limitations in using the  for flood frequency analysis and suggest the ƁrIII and ƁrXII as consistent alternatives worth exploring.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Grey water footprints of U.S. thermoelectric power plants from 2010–2016</paper_heading>
	<author>Christopher M. Chini, Lauren H. Logan, Ashlynn S. Stillwell</author>
	<abstract>Water demands for power generation within the energy-water nexus focus on both consumptive and withdrawn water for thermoelectric power plant cooling. However, the consumptive-based approach of water footprinting is incongruent with withdrawn water. Grey water footprints of thermoelectric power plants associated with thermal pollution offer a proxy method to integrate the consumptive (blue) water footprint concept with withdrawn water. In this study, we compute the monthly grey water footprints of thermoelectric power plants from 2010–2016 in the United States. The calculation of grey water footprint relies on return flow and temperature effluent data, which are available through the Energy Information Administration. However, in cases where these data are unavailable, we present a model for estimating grey water footprints based on fuel type, return flow, and generation. Grey water footprints show a peak in the winter and summer months with lower volumes in the spring and fall. Additionally, the national grey water footprint was 18% greater in 2016 than 2010 (408 km3 versus 347 km3), peaking in 2015 at 505 km3. Grey water footprints of electricity generally occur in the eastern area of the United States, where once-through cooling systems are most prevalent. We discuss the potential of grey water footprints as a policy tool for assessing aquatic ecosystem impacts of thermal pollution. Our study provides the first quantification of grey water footprints due to thermoelectric power plant pollution in the United States and provides a means of estimating grey water footprints with limited data.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Improved pore network models to simulate single-phase flow in porous media by coupling with lattice Boltzmann method</paper_heading>
	<author>Jianlin Zhao, Feifei Qin, Dominique Derome, Qinjun Kang, Jan Carmeliet</author>
	<abstract>In this paper, different pore network models to simulate single-phase flow in porous media are built and their accuracy is evaluated. In addition to the conventional pore network model (CPNM) which consists of regular pore bodies and throat bonds, three improved pore network models (IPNMs) are developed allowing to better describing the real pore and throat geometry. The first improved pore network model (IPNM1) replaces the regular throat bond with a throat bond showing the real throat cross section. The second improvement (IPNM2) uses a series of sub-throat bonds with varying cross sections to better describe the real throat geometry, which is firstly proposed in this paper. The third model (IPNM3) extracts the real pore-throat-pore geometry without simplification. The conductance of fluid flow through these more realistic throat bonds is calculated by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The accuracy and computational efficiency of the different pore network models are evaluated taking the LBM simulation over the whole porous medium as reference solution. The global permeability and detailed pressure distributions in the pores for the different pore network models are validated. The results show that the accuracy of the pore network model increases from CPNM to IPNM3, but at the expense of increasing computational cost. This study suggests that IPNM3 can replace a whole-domain LBM simulation with similar accuracy but much lower computational cost. As a first-order approximation the newly proposed IPNM2 is suggested as good compromise between accuracy and computational cost.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Efficient extraction of pore networks from massive tomograms via geometric domain decomposition</paper_heading>
	<author>Zohaib Atiq Khan, Ali Elkamel, Jeff T Gostick</author>
	<abstract>Image-based modelling of porous media to study the transport and reaction processes has become an essential tool. The availability of increasingly large image datasets at high resolution creates a need to develop algorithms that can process massive size images at a low computational cost. This study presents an efficient workflow to extract pore networks from large size porous domains using a watershed segmentation with geometrical domain decomposition. The method subdivides a porous image into smaller overlapping subdomains and performs a watershed segmentation on each subdomain in parallel or serial modes of operation to save CPU time or memory RAM, respectively. The computational performance of the algorithm was analyzed on a large size image and found to consume 50 percent less memory and upto 7 times less CPU time than the standard watershed implementation. Pore networks of four massive digital rock images were extracted and the the effective permeability predicted by the networks agreed well with previously investigated values illustrating the accuracy of the method. An additional application of this method, taking advantage of the reduced computational cost, is the upgrading of low-resolution image. It was found that increasing the resolution of a coarse image leads to more accurate predictions by helping the watershed segmenation prouduce a more faithful pore network model. The developed algorithm is implemented in Python, and included in the open source project PoreSpy. It uses highly optimized and efficient modules such as Dask and Numba to obtain the maximum performance. The domain decomposition approach used here will also lend itself well to processing on distributed memory clusters, enabling the processing of even larger porous domains.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Copula density-driven metrics for sensitivity analysis: Theory and application to flow and transport in porous media</paper_heading>
	<author>Aronne Dell'Oca, Alberto Guadagnini, Monica Riva</author>
	<abstract>We introduce original sensitivity analysis metrics with the aim of assistingdiagnosis of the functioning of a given model. We do so by characterizing model-induced dependencies between a target model output and selected model input(s) through the associated bivariate copuladensity. The latter fully characterizes the dependencies between two random variables at any order (i.e., without being limited to linear dependence), independent of the marginal behavior of the two variables. As a metric to assess sensitivity, we rely on the absolute distance betweenthe copuladensity associated with the target model output and a model input and its counterpart associated with two independent variables. We then provide two sensitivity indices which allow characterizing (i) the global (with respect to the input) value of the sensitivity and (ii) the degree of variability (across the range of the input values) of the sensitivity for each value that the prescribed model output can possibly undertake, as driven by the governing model. In this sense, our approach to sensitivity is global with respect to model input(s) and local with respect to model output, thus enabling one to discriminate the relevance of an input across the entire range of values of the modeling goal of interest. We exemplify the use of our approach and illustrate the type of information it can provide by focusing on an analytical test function and on two scenarios related to flow and transport in porous media.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Explaining persistent incomplete mixing in multicomponent reactive transport with Eulerian stochastic model</paper_heading>
	<author>Alexandre M. Tartakovsky, David Barajas-Solano</author>
	<abstract>We present an Eulerian stochastic advection–diffusion–reaction (SADR) model and use it to explain incomplete mixing typically observed in transport experiments with bimolecular reactions. Unlike traditional advection–dispersion–reaction (ADR) models, the SADR model describes mechanical and diffusive mixing as two separate processes. In the SADR model, mechanical mixing is driven by random advective velocity whose variance is given by the coefficient of mechanical dispersion. The diffusive mixing is modeled as a Fickian diffusion process with the effective diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate that the sum of the two coefficients is equal to the dispersion coefficient, but only the effective diffusion coefficient contributes to the mixing-controlled reactions. We use experimental results of Gramling et al. ** to show that for transport and bimolecular reactions in porous media, the SADR model is significantly more accurate than the ADR model, which overestimates the concentration of the reaction product by as much as 60%. We also show that the SADR model predicts an experimentally observed bell-shaped spatial distribution of the reactive product concentration, while the ADR model results in a concentration distribution with an unphysical kink.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Quantification of the information content of Darcy fluxes associated with hydraulic conductivity fields evaluated at diverse scales</paper_heading>
	<author>Aronne Dell'Oca, Alberto Guadagnini, Monica Riva</author>
	<abstract>We rest on an Information Theory perspective and assess (i) the average information content and (i) the information shared between Darcy flux fields associated with fields of hydraulic conductivity (K) characterized by differing support (or measurement) scale. We treat hydraulic conductivity as a spatial random field, characterized by a given distribution and correlation structure. The latter is modeled through a truncated power law variogram (TPV), which explicitly takes into account a characteristic length scale of the support volume of K through a lower cutoff scale. We then frame our study in a numerical Monte Carlo context where groundwater flow is evaluated across a collection of realizations of hydraulic conductivity characterized by different values of the TPV parameters and subject to uniform in the mean flow. We quantify information through the Shannon entropy of the probability mass functions of the Darcy flux components as well as the mutual information and the multivariate mutual information respectively shared by pairs and triplets of Darcy flux components related to hydraulic conductivity fields evaluated at diverse scales and associated with various levels of heterogeneity. Partitioning of multivariate mutual information according to unique, redundant and synergetic contributions is also quantified. We found consistent trends (i) in the variation of the average information content with respect to the size of lower cutoff scale and (ii) in the way information is shared between pairs and triplets of Darcy flux components associated with diverse support scales of the underlying conductivities.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>An approximate analytical solution for non-Darcian flow in a confined aquifer with a single well circulation groundwater heat pump system</paper_heading>
	<author>Kun Tu, Qiang Wu, Jirka Simunek, Ke Zhu, ... Shengheng Xu</author>
	<abstract>An analytical model is proposed in this study to describe transient drawdown induced by non-Darcian flow in a confined aquifer with a single well circulation groundwater heat pump system. The Izbash equation and a linearization method are employed to describe non-Darcian flow in the horizontal direction of a confined aquifer and to approximate the nonlinear term in the governing equation, respectively. By applying a combination of the Laplace and Fourier cosine transforms, an approximate analytical solution in the Laplace domain is obtained, which is numerically inverted to obtain transient drawdown in the time domain using the Stehfest algorithm method. The results of the derived analytical solution for the special case of Darcian flow (m = 1) correspond well with the existing solution derived using Darcy's law. The steady-state analytical solution in the time domain is obtained by applying the Fourier cosine transform. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influence of selected parameters, such as the power index m, the radial hydraulic conductivity Kr, the aquifer specific storage S, and the length of the sealed section d2, on drawdown. The results show that each parameter has its influence period on drawdown, and that drawdown is more sensitive to the power index m compared to other parameters.

	<paper_heading>The effects of water markets: Evidence from the Rio Grande</paper_heading>
	<author>Peter Debaere, Tianshu Li</author>
	<abstract>We present empirical evidence of the impact of water markets on agricultural production. From 1954 to 2012, we compare the crop composition in counties of the Rio Grande water market with neighboring control counties before and after the establishment of the water market in 1971. What we find is consistent with water markets facilitating a shift from low- to high-value crops, or, in terms of our empirical proxies, from less productive crops that generate on average less dollars per unit of water to ones that are more productive. We find that such reallocations are especially prevalent in times of drought.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A fractal model for the electrical conductivity of water-saturated porous media during mineral precipitation-dissolution processes</paper_heading>
	<author>Flore Rembert, Damien Jougnot, Luis Guarracino</author>
	<abstract>Precipitation and dissolution are prime processes in carbonate rocks and being able to monitor them is of major importance for aquifer and reservoir exploitation or environmental studies. Electrical conductivity is a physical property sensitive both to transport phenomena of porous media and to dissolution and precipitation processes. However, its quantitative use depends on the effectiveness of the petrophysical relationship to relate the electrical conductivity to hydrological properties of interest. In this work, we develop a new physically-based model to estimate the electrical conductivity by upscaling a microstructural description of water-saturated fractal porous media. This model is successfully compared to published data from both unconsolidated and consolidated samples, or during precipitation and dissolution numerical experiments. For the latter, we show that the permeability can be linked to the predicted electrical conductivity.</abstract>

	<author>A.R. Kacimov, Yu.V. Obnosov, J. Šimůnek</author>
	<abstract>An isobar generated by a line or point sink draining a confined semi-infinite aquifer is an analytic curve, to which a steady 2-D plane or axisymmetric Darcian flow converges. This sink may represent an excavation, ditch, or wadi on Earth, or a channel on Mars. The strength of the sink controls the form of the ditch depression: for 2-D flow, the shape of the isobar varies from a zero-depth channel to a semicircle; for axisymmetric flow, depressions as flat as a disk or as deep as a hemisphere are reconstructed. In the model of axisymmetric flow, a fictitious J.R. Philip's point sink is mirrored by an infinite array of sinks and sources placed along a vertical line perpendicular to a horizontal water table. A topographic depression is kept at constant capillary pressure (water content, Kirchhoff potential). None of these singularities belongs to the real flow domain, evaporating unsaturated Gardnerian soil. Saturated flow towards a triangular, empty or partially-filled ditch is tackled by conformal mappings and the solution of Riemann's problem in a reference plane. The obtained seepage flow rate is used as a right-hand side in an ODE of a Cauchy problem, the solution of which gives the draw-up curves, i.e., the rise of the water level in an initially empty trench. HYDRUS-2D computations for flows in saturated and unsaturated soils match well the analytical solutions. The modeling results are applied to assessments of real hydrological fluxes on Earth and paleo-reconstructions of Martian hydrology-geomorphology.

	<author>Barbara F. Esteves, Paulo L.C. Lage, Paulo Couto, Anthony R. Kovscek</author>
	<abstract>A pore-network modeling approach is proposed to understand mineral dissolution regimes during reactive transport, as well as changes in porosity and permeability. The transport problem is implemented with full consideration of the mass balance of the solute in all pore spaces, including pore-bodies and throats. The changes in geometry of the pore network due to calcite dissolution are taken into account based on the rate of the heterogeneous chemical reaction happening at the mineral surface. The networks consider two- and three-dimensional domains with a variety of number of pores. The evolution of network geometry and flow properties are investigated under various flow conditions using representative Péclet and Damköhler numbers to understand the interplay of transport and reaction. A behavior diagram is constructed aiming to identify different regimes and their boundaries. The dissolution patterns identified in this study further the applicability of the pore-network model approach as a tool for understanding of reactive transport and dissolution processes.</abstract>

	<author>Morteza Aminnaji, Fabrice Golfier, Vahid J. Niasar, Masoud Babaei</author>
	<abstract>The biofilm plays an important role in NAPL bioremediation, natural attenuation and the flow behaviour of contaminant in porous media. Therefore, NAPL biodegradation in the presence of any bacteria in the porous media needs to be considered for more accurate prediction of contaminant remediation from the soil and groundwater. The complex interaction between the NAPL biodegradation/dissolution and physiochemical bacteria (biofilm) growth single bond which depends on both time and space single bond results in difficulties in simulation of NAPL bioremediation in the porous media. In this work, the natural attenuation process is simulated using three-dimensional pore network models to investigate natural bioremediation and dissolution of NAPL in presence of different heterogeneities arising from uncorrelated and correlated pore radii distribution. The impact of an additional phase (biofilm) on transport and NAPL dissolution is dynamically incorporated in the pore network model with simplifying assumptions such as fully available NAPL for biodegradation and dissolution. Under such assumptions, the results indicate that as pore scale heterogeneity (in the form of correlation length of pore radii of pore networks) increases, the biofilm growth decreases resulting in a reduction of NAPL bioremediation and dissolution. As such it is critical to consider pore scale heterogeneity in predicting bioremediation efficiency. Additionally, we found that Kozeny-Carman equation fail to predict the permeability changes due to biofilm growth/extinction.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>On the prediction of three-phase relative permeabilities using two-phase constitutive relationships</paper_heading>
	<author>Gerhard Schäfer, Raphaël di Chiara Roupert, Amir H. Alizadeh, Mohammad Piri</author>
	<abstract>The predictions of two recent and two classical mathematical models are compared with experimentally measured three-phase relative permeabilities. Experimentally determined constitutive relationships in two-phase systems were used as model input parameters to numerically predict relative permeabilities (kr) in three-phase systems. Then the estimated results were compared with experimental three-phase permeabilities measured along decreasing water saturation/decreasing oil saturation/increasing gas saturation (DDI) paths. The results of the individual models to each of the three fluids involved (water, oil, and gas) were analyzed in detail. The simulated results showed that the Total Differential (TD) compatible model overestimates significantly both the global mobilities as well as the relative phase permeabilities in the three-phase system. There was improvement in the prediction with the TD compatible model when experimental data were used to locally impose the global mobility and fractional water and gas fluxes in the ternary diagram. Globally, the best prediction of the measured kr values was obtained with the so-called mechanistic model. However, its numerical implementation requires a preliminary calibration of the relative phase permeabilities in a three-phase system against experimental data along one DDI path to quantify the required six characteristic coefficients. In contrast to the TD compatible model, which by construction does not exhibit any numerical instabilities, elliptic zones in the water-oil (NAPL)-gas ternary diagram were identified in the mechanistic model.</abstract>

	<abstract>We detail a new semi-analytic solution for the slope beach problem in which linearization of the initial waveform is not carried out to provide the exact corresponding boundary condition for the transformed problem. Numerical code benchmarking requires the construction of exact solutions to check the convergence order and efficiently compare the simulations using fine meshes. We quantify the impact of the linearization assumption and compare two situations (linearized and non-linearized) with a second-order finite volume code. The accuracy of the shoreline velocity, maximum run-up, and maximum run-down situations, in particular, are of crucial importance in applications as they characterize the inundation and impact intensity of a wave on potential infrastructure. To this end, we provide two sets of spreadsheets, containing highly accurate approximations of the exact non-linearized solution for cases (c) and (d) of Carrier et al.

	<paper_heading>Quantification of temporal variability of vertical soil moisture movement through an unsaturated zone</paper_heading>
	<author>Ching-Min Chang, Hund-Der Yeh, Mo-Hsiung Chuang</author>
	<abstract>Understanding of the soil moisture movement process in the unsaturated zone is crucial for an accurate estimate of the rate of recharge to the aquifer. The goal of the present research is therefore to quantify the temporal variability of moisture movement through the unsaturated zone. A new framework for quantifying the temporal variability of soil moisture movement over a relatively large space scale through the unsaturated zone is proposed. The unsaturated zone is treated as a nonlinear soil moisture reservoir with a single random input, the effective infiltration, and a single random output, the recharge to the saturated zone, in time. The variation of volumetric soil moisture in response to the variation of effective infiltration is represented by a nonlinear functional series involving generalizations of the convolution integral, which underlies the concept of unit hydrograph. A second order autoregressive model is used to account for the temporal behavior of the input process. The use of Fourier-Stieltjes representation approach enables developing closed-form expressions for the variance of volumetric soil moisture and cross-covariance of the soil moisture and effective infiltration. The variance can be viewed as an index of temporal variability in soil moisture or uncertainty involved in the modeling process. The cross-covariance contains information about how two processes are correlated in time. Focus of analysis is placed on the influence of the controlling parameters on the temporal variability of soil moisture movement.</abstract>

	<author>Abdelaziz Beljadid, Luis Cueto-Felgueroso, Ruben Juanes</author>
	<abstract>We propose a thermodynamic approach to modeling unsaturated flow in porous media, where the liquid saturation is understood as the state variable. The free energy functional is designed as a symmetric expansion of the traditional capillary energy density in Richards equation, therefore removing ambiguities on the interpretation of the higher-order term in the model equation. The proposed definition renders a formulation that leads naturally to an entropy function of the system, and we show that the model describes an entropy-increasing process for an isolated system. The new formulation reproduces gravity fingering during infiltration in soil. We show that the nonlinear and singular structure of the capillary pinning function in the fourth-order term plays a fundamental role in the behavior and stability of infiltration fronts, promoting front pinning and the persistence of fingered infiltration at relatively large flux ratios.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>(Multi)wavelets increase both accuracy and efficiency of standard Godunov-type hydrodynamic models: Robust 2D approaches</paper_heading>
	<author>Georges Kesserwani, Mohammad Kazem Sharifian</author>
	<abstract>Multiwavelets (MW) enable the compression, analysis and assembly of model data on a multiresolution grid within Godunov-type solvers based on second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) and first-order finite volume (FV1) methods. Multiwavelet adaptivity has been studied extensively with one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic models (Kesserwani et al., 2019), revealing that MWDG2 can be 20 times faster than uniform DG2 and 2 times faster than uniform FV1, while preserving the accuracy and robustness of the underlying formulation. The potential of the MWDG2 scheme has yet to be studied for two-dimensional (2D) modelling, but this requires a design that robustly and efficiently solves the 2D shallow water equations (SWE) with complex source terms and wetting and drying. This paper presents a two-dimensional MWDG2 scheme that: (1) adopts a slope-decoupled DG2 solver as a reference scheme, for its ability to deliver well-balanced piecewise-planar solutions shaped by a simplified 3-component basis; and, (2) adapts the multiresolution analysis of multiwavelets for compatibility with the slope-decoupled DG2 basis. A scaled reformulation of slope-decoupled DG2 is presented alongside two multiwavelet approaches that yield MWDG2 schemes with similar properties, and a Haar wavelet FV1 (HFV1) variant for adapting piecewise-constant model data. The performance of the adaptive HFV1 and MWDG2 solvers is explored alongside their uniform counterparts, while analysing their accuracy, efficiency, grid-coarsening ability, reliability in handling wet-dry fronts across steep bed-slopes, and ability to capture features relevant to practical hydraulic modelling. The results indicate a particular multiwavelet approach that allows the MWDG2 scheme to exploit its grid-coarsening ability for the widest range of flow types. Results also indicate that the proposed (multi)wavelet-based adaptive schemes are even more efficient for the 2D case. Accompanying model software is openly available online.</abstract>

	<abstract>This article studies the individual contribution of each term in the Navier-Stokes-Darcy (Brinkman) equation to the fluid linear momentum balance and the consequences of opting for the Darcy or Brinkman equations in 3D reactive flow simulations of a vuggy carbonate. A two-scale continuum model was used to simulate the acidification of a carbonate sample using the Darcy and Brinkman equations. Rock heterogeneity is considered in the initial porosity and permeability fields, which are calculated directly from micro-CT images. Simulations showed that the Darcy equation predicts the acid breakthrough earlier in most cases. The convective acceleration term in the Brinkman equation plays an important role in describing the fluid momentum balance at high injection velocities, and this is a clear evidence against the use of the Darcy equation to model reactive flow in such conditions.</abstract>

	<author>Joaquín Jiménez-Martínez, Andrés Alcolea, Julien A. Straubhaar, Philippe Renard</author>
	<abstract>The impact of phases distribution on mixing and reaction is hardly assessable experimentally. We use a multiple point statistical method, which belongs to the family of machine learning algorithms, to generate simulations of phases distributions from data out of laboratory experiments. The simulations honour the saturation of the laboratory experiments, resemble the statistical distributions of several geometric descriptors and respect the physics imposed by capillary forces. The simulated phases distributions are used to compute solute transport. The breakthrough curves reveal that different phases distributions lead to broad ranges of early arrival times and long-term tailings as saturation decreases. For a given saturation, a similar long-term scaling of mixing area, interface length, and corresponding reactivity is observed regardless of phases distribution. However, phases distribution has a clear impact on the final values (before breakthrough) of area of mixing, interface length and mass of reaction product.</abstract>

	<author>Mandana Samari Kermani, Saeed Jafari, Mohammad Rahnama, Amir Raoof</author>
	<abstract>In this study, we have developed a combined lattice Boltzmann-smoothed profile method to explore coupled mechanisms governing transport of colloids and their retention in porous media. We have considered flow in a constricted tube and included hydrodynamic, gravity, buoyancy, van der Waals and electrostatic forces to simulate colloid transport and aggregation. A major advantage of this complete formulation is that it does not require any common assumptions which neglect the effects of inter-particle forces (e.g., dilute suspension, or clean bed filtration), and pore structure changes due to colloid retention. The results show an increase in colloid aggregation and surface coverage as pore velocity decreases. However, the pore void fraction and its conductivity show a reduction with decreased velocity. In the presence of a secondary energy minimum, rolling of colloids on the grain surface is demonstrated to be the major mechanism that prevents pore clogging. Details of these observations are provided and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of model parameters is performed and discussed.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>All in order: Distribution of serially correlated order statistics with applications to hydrological extremes</paper_heading>
	<author>Francesco Serinaldi, Federico Lombardo, Chris G. Kilsby</author>
	<abstract>Classic extreme value theory provides asymptotic distributions of block maxima (BM) Y or peaks over threshold (POT). However, as BM and POT are relatively small subsets of the values assumed by the parent process Z, alternative approaches have been proposed to make inferences on extremes by using intermediate values and non-asymptotic models. In this study, we investigate the finite sample theory of extremes based on order statistics, and present a set of results enabling the analysis of the properties of non-asymptotic distributions of BM in finite-size blocks of data under the assumption that the parent process Z has stationary temporal dependence. In particular, we suggest the beta-binomial distribution (FβB) as a suitable approximation of the marginal distribution of order statistics and BM under dependence, thus generalizing the theoretical results available under independence. We demonstrate the usefulness of the FβB distribution in three conceptual applications of hydrological interest. Firstly, we review the so-called Complete Time-series Analysis (CTA) framework, showing that the differences between FY and FZ are due to the inherent theoretical nature of the processes Y and Z and the different probabilistic failure scenarios described by FY and FZ. Secondly, we provide a theoretical rule to select the number of the largest maxima (LM) and over-threshold exceedances (OT) required to approximate the desired portion of the upper tail of FZ with specified accuracy. Finally, we discuss how the FβB distribution offers an interpretation and generalization of the so-called metastatistical extreme value (MEV) framework and its simplified version (SMEV), avoiding the use of high-dimensional joint distributions and preliminary data thresholding and declustering. All methodological results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations involving widely used stochastic processes with persistence. Real-world stream flow data are also analyzed as proof of concept.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Relative importance of conceptual and computational errors when delineating saltwater intrusion from resistivity inverse models in heterogeneous coastal aquifers</paper_heading>
	<author>Andrés González-Quirós, Jean-Christophe Comte</author>
	<abstract>In coastal areas, geological heterogeneity influences the geometry and characteristics of the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone. Geophysical electrical and electromagnetic methods are increasingly used to delineate the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone or for groundwater model calibration. However, in practical applications, it is common when assessing pore water salinity from resistivity models to disregard the spatial variability of the aquifer properties assuming pore salinity is the dominant control on bulk electrical conductivity. In this paper we use a coupled hydrogeophysical model to assess the discrepancies in recovered salinity caused by the geophysical inversion and the application of the chosen petrophysical model when heterogeneity is ignored. We find that errors made when neglecting heterogeneity during petrophysical transformation are equivalent or higher in magnitude than inversion errors, more so when an inappropriate petrophysical model is used, but exhibit different spatial distribution. The results show that their combined effect results in significant overestimation of the spreading of the mixing zone. The analysis provides new insights to the groundwater community to better evaluate the reliability of geophysically-derived information when delineating the freshwater-saltwater interface or when geophysics is used quantitatively as part of model scenario simulation, uncertainty analysis or optimisation strategies.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>On proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced-order modeling of groundwater flow through heterogeneous porous media with point source singularity</paper_heading>
	<author>Saumava Dey, Anirban Dhar</author>
	<abstract>Groundwater, being a vital component of the natural water resource system, needs continuous monitoring and dynamic management strategies. That said, we require computationally inexpensive groundwater flow models for repetitive solutions with desirable accuracy under budgetary limitation(s). Natural aquifer systems inherit strong heterogeneity at local scales. In this work, we have proposed ordinary kriging-based sequential algorithm for generating replicates of randomly distributed heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field (Monte Carlo method-based algorithm) conditioned by field values from sampled locations in an irregular-unstructured grid system. Finite Volume method-based groundwater models often encounter difficulties with the representation of point source/sink terms operating within the domain. In this paper, we have proposed an irregular-unstructured grid Finite Volume discretization technique for overcoming the singularity of point source/sink term to yield a consistent output with different grid dimensions. Furthermore, full-system groundwater models often come with a substantial computational burden. Hence, reduction in model order cuts down the computational expenses (in terms of CPU time and usage) to a significant level. We have also put forth a model order reduction methodology for three different illustrative pumping tests. The proposed framework for the model order reduction projects the governing groundwater flow equation onto a set of identified patterns or orthonormal basis functions, applying the Galerkin Projection method to compute a vector of time-dependent coefficients. We have performed pattern identification by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of snapshots of full-system model simulation data at selected time instants within the pumping test time domain. The numerical results of the proposed reduced-order models show a good approximation of the full-system models at a comparatively lesser computational time. The accuracy and efficiency of the models attempt to ensure their potential applicability for identifying groundwater dynamics.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A pore-scale experimental investigation of process-dependent capillary desaturation</paper_heading>
	<author>Abdelhalim I. A. Mohamed, Mahdi Khishvand, Mohammad Piri</author>
	<abstract>A series of micro-scale core-flooding experiments were conducted in a miniature water-wet Berea sandstone sample to examine how changes in the desaturation (water-displacing-oil) protocol impact the non-wetting phase recovery and to provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first pore-scale evidences of the associated displacement subtleties. We studied (i) the continuous displacement mode (CDM), which consisted of a series of imbibition tests with increasing capillary numbers and similar initially connected oil, and (ii) the discontinuous displacement mode (DDM), which included a drainage followed by a multi-rate imbibition test. During all experiments, a cutting-edge imaging platform was employed to visualize the fluid occupancies in the pore space. The in-situ saturation measurements showed that, at a given capillary number, the non-wetting phase recovery was more efficient under the continuous mode during which the oil phase was connected prior to each imbibition. This is attributed to the changes in the order by which the pore-scale displacement events take place before entrapment. For the DDM, however, the entrainment of oil clusters is the governing recovery mechanism, and the desaturation process was observed only when a threshold capillary number was reached. These findings are supported by pore-scale fluid occupancy maps demonstrating piston-like and snap-off events during the capillary-driven flow processes as well as trapped cluster entrainment during the viscous-dominated flow tests. Moreover, this investigation presents previously unidentified pore-scale displacement events in natural porous media, such as fragmentation and coalescence of trapped non-wetting phase globules prior to entrainment.These mechanisms took place at intermediate capillary numbers and mostly under the discontinuous displacement mode before the threshold of mobilization was reached. The capillary desaturation process under CDM was found to be gradual and more pronounced compared to that under the DDM mode. It is also demonstrated that even though the pore-scale displacement mechanisms responsible for oil recovery are different for CDM and DDM, the viscous-dominated imbibition tests produce similar distributions of trapped oil clusters under both cases.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Coupling surface flow and subsurface flow in complex soil structures using mimetic finite differences</paper_heading>
	<author>Ethan T. Coon, J. David Moulton, Evgeny Kikinzon, Markus Berndt, ... Scott L. Painter</author>
	<abstract>We explore the coupling of surface and subsurface flows on fully unstructured meshes that conform to complex soil structures. To accommodate the distorted meshes that inevitably result from explicit representation of complex soil structures, we leverage the structure of the Mimetic Finite Difference (MFD) spatial discretization scheme to couple surface and subsurface flows. The MFD method achieves second-order accuracy and maintains local mass conservation on distorted meshes. We couple the diffusion wave approximation for surface flows to the Richards equation for subsurface flow, ensuring continuity of both pressure and flux between the surface and subsurface. The MFD method is particularly convenient for this coupling because it uses face-based constraints in the subsurface system that can be expressed as face-pressure unknowns. Those unknowns are coincident with surface cell-based unknowns, thus allowing the discrete surface system to be directly substituted into the subsurface system and solved implicitly as a global system. Robust representation of the transition between wet and dry surface conditions requires upwinding of the relative permeability and is facilitated by globalization in the nonlinear solver. The approach and its implementation in the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) are evaluated by comparison to previously published benchmarks. Using runoff from soils with patchy groundcover (duff) as an example, we show that the new method converges significantly faster in mesh convergence tests than the commonly used two-point flux approximation.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Multiscale model for flow and transport in CO2-enhanced coalbed methane recovery incorporating gas mixture adsorption effects</paper_heading>
	<author>T.D. Le, Q.D. Ha, I Panfilov, C Moyne</author>
	<abstract>In this work we develop a multiscale model for flow and transport problem in CO2-enhanced coalbed methane recovery. The coalbed methane reservoir is characterized by two levels of porosity associated with nanopores in the matrix and cleat network. Mass conservation equations for fluid mixture (CH4 and CO2) in the matrix at the microscale are rigorously derived by using the formal homogenization technique taking into account the gas mixture adsorption in the nanopores. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used to compute the gas adsorption isotherms and the solvation force acting on the nanopore wall, showing a much more pronounced adsorption capacity of CO2 compared to CH4. The average transport equations in the matrix together with the multiphase flow problem in fracture network (gas mixture and water) are homogenized giving rise to a macroscopic model ruled by the effective conductivities, partition and transfer coefficients. The cleat permeability evolution due to deformation is taken into account through a three-scale poromechanical model reported in a previous work. Computational simulations illustrate the macroscopic laws underlying the gas pressure distributions, cleat closure phenomena and CH4 production curve enhanced by CO2 injection.

	<paper_heading>Evaluation of the performance of multiple-well hydraulic barriers on enhancing groundwater extraction in a coastal aquifer</paper_heading>
	<author>Lingtong Shi, Chunhui Lu, Yu Ye, Yifan Xie, Jichun Wu</author>
	<abstract>Hydraulic barriers using either two or three injection wells are studied analytically to evaluate their performance on improving groundwater extraction in a coastal aquifer under the threat of seawater intrusion. The multiple well system is operated by extracting fresh groundwater through a landward well and partially reinjecting into the aquifer through two or three wells located parallel to the coastline and between the interface toe and the extraction well. We found that with appropriate well locations and pumping rates, the multiple-well system could outperform a single extraction well in terms of net extraction rate, which is up to 90% higher for an aquifer with a thickness of 20 m, hydraulic conductivity of 10 m/d, and freshwater influx of 0.24 m2/d. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the monotonicity of the maximum net extraction rate is determined by the total injection rate. In specific, when the total injection rate is fixed, the maximum net extraction rate is a non-monotonic function of the distance between the injection well and the coastline and the distance between two injection wells, resulting in a global maximum. When the total injection rate is not fixed, by contrast, the maximum net extraction rate depends on the total injection rate, and a larger total injection rate leads to a larger maximum net extraction rate. By using different injection rates for side and middle injection wells of the three-injection-well hydraulic barrier, the maximum net extraction rate could be further improved, depending on the distance between the two injection wells. Analytical analyses can provide initial guidance for the design of a multiple-well system in coastal aquifers with the purpose of obtaining enhanced extraction under the threats of seawater intrusion.</abstract>

	<author>Xiaoguang Liu, Yuhong Zeng, Gabriel Katul, Wenxin Huai, Yu Bai</author>
	<abstract>The effect of emergent stems on the transport of downstream floating particles (e.g., buoyant seeds) is explored theoretically and experimentally at moderate to high Reynolds number (Rd=2Ubas/υ>300) in an open channel, where Ub is the bulk velocity, as is stem radius, and ν is the kinematic viscosity. Longitudinal dispersion (Dl) of such seeds is shown to be given by Dl=Up3τ02η(1−η)/2/(S1+ητ0Up) thereby requiring the bulk transport velocity of particles Up, spacing between canopy elements S1, collision efficiency η between a particle and the stem, and a wake trapping time scale τ0. Linkages between Up and Ub, and terms η and τ0 are then derived using inhomogeneous flow characteristics adjacent to the stem with physical properties of particles. A semiempirical model with potential flow theory around the stem is introduced to estimate η whereas τ0 is shown to be related to the bulk drag coefficient and radius of stems. The Dl is experimentally determined across a wide range of Rd and particle sizes and shown to be in good agreement with the proposed model calculations.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Optimal design of in-situ bioremediation system using the meshless element-free Galerkin method and particle swarm optimization</paper_heading>
	<author>Tinesh Pathania, T.I. Eldho, Andrea Bottacin-Busolin</author>
	<abstract>An optimal design of in-situ bioremediation system for contaminated aquifer sites mainly depends on the injection, extraction well locations and their pumping rates. Previous studies have used discretization approaches such as finite difference method (FDM) or finite element method (FEM) to solve the equations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport (GFCT) that characterize the bioremediation processes. In these numerical models, well locations can only lie at the grid nodes and therefore, the locations other than the grid nodes remain unexplored for the optimal in-situ bioremediation. To explore such locations, in this study a meshless simulation model called BIOEFGM is developed using the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM) and coupled with the particle swarm optimization (PSO). BIOEFGM model provides flexibility in adding injection/extraction wells anywhere in the computational domain during the entire optimization procedure. However, FDM/FEM requires meshing and re-meshing of the computational domain for each set of wells and it increases the computational efforts significantly for solving the optimization problem. In this paper, the proposed BIOEFGM-PSO simulation-optimization (S/O) model is first applied to a well-known bioremediation problem and then to a field type large aquifer problem. The simulation results of BIOEFGM are verified with those from the RT3D simulations. The estimated bioremediation cost from the BIOEFGM-PSO model for the first problem is found to be lesser in comparison to the same calculated with different S/O models in the previous studies. The results of this problem also show that optimized in-situ bioremediation system designed by proposed S/O model takes less remediation time and also favor effective biodegradation of contaminants. For both the problems, BIOEFGM-PSO identified optimal well locations at positions other than that of discretized nodes and it leads to efficient bioremediation. It indicates the effectiveness of the BIOEFGM-PSO model and therefore, can be applied for designing the better optimized in-situ bioremediation systems for field problems.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Deep learning for automated characterization of pore-scale wettability</paper_heading>
	<author>Wonjin Yun, Yimin Liu, Anthony R. Kovscek</author>
	<abstract>A procedure combining experiments and deep learning is demonstrated to acquire pore-scale images of oil- and water-wet surfaces over a large field of view in microfluidic devices and to classify wettability based upon these pore scale images. Deep learning supplants the manual, time-consuming, error-prone investigation and categorization of such images. Image datasets were obtained by visualizing the distribution of immiscible phases (n-decane and water) within in-house fabricated micromodels containing sandstone-type and carbonate-type pore structures. The reference dataset consists of 6400 color images binned into four classes for sandstone (water- or oil-wet surfaces) and carbonate (water- or oil-wet surfaces) pore-network patterns. There are 1600 images per class. During 10 sequential training and testing runs of the deep-learning algorithm, 3000, 100, and 100 images were randomly assigned per each rock pattern as the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. We trained and optimized both a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCN) and Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) using the image data. The ConvNet performs better as 5 and 8 layers are implemented, as expected. The FCN shows an average test set accuracy for binary surface wettability classification of 87.4% for sandstone rock type and 98.7% for carbonate rock type pore networks. Distinctive heterogeneity in the carbonate rock type and its relevant phase saturation profile resulted in a better prediction accuracy. The best ConvNet models shows an average test set accuracy of binary surface wettability classification of 99.4 ± 0.1% for both sandstone-type and carbonate pore networks. Heterogenous pore sizes and an abundance of small pores amplify the effects of wetting and aid identification. Overall, the test set accuracy for the simultaneous classification of four classes including both sandstone (water- or oil-wet) and carbonate rock pattern (water- or oil-wet) is 98.5% with an 8-layer ConvNet. Performance of the deep-learning model is further interpreted using saliency maps that indicate the degree to which each pixel in the image affects the classification score. Pixels at and adjacent to interfaces are most important to classification.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Hybrid multi-scale model for partially saturated media based on a pore network approach and lattice Boltzmann method</paper_heading>
	<author>Eduard Puig Montellá, Chao Yuan, Bruno Chareyre, Antonio Gens</author>
	<abstract>A model combining the efficiency of the pore-network (PN) models and the accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is proposed. We introduce a multi-scale approach based on a decomposition of the granular assembly into small subsets. A tetrahedrization is considered to describe the pore space and extract the subsets. Hydrostatic properties such as entry capillary pressure, liquid morphology and capillary pressure - degree of saturation relationship are evaluated for each pore throat (subset) of the granular system. This information is incorporated into the pore-network model to reproduce the macro-scale effects during a primary drainage. The hybrid method is able to reproduce accurately the capillary pressure - volume relationship and the motion of the interface during the drainage process. The results obtained with the hybrid method evidence the capability of the method to investigate complex phenomena. Additionally, the combination of PN and LBM leads to a significant gain in terms of computation resources. Finally, the results obtained with a fully resolved LBM and the hybrid model help us validate the accuracy of pore-scale methods based on approximations (MS-P and Incircle methods).</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Beyond marsh drowning: The many faces of marsh loss (and gain)</paper_heading>
	<author>G. Mariotti</author>
	<abstract>The morphodynamics of tidal marshes is investigated using a novel model (MarshMorpho2D) that couples 2D tidal dynamics, wave dynamics, mass-conserving sediment transport, edge erosion, pond dynamics, and marsh upland migration. By only changing tidal range, sediment supply, and RSLR rate, the model reproduces a great variety of spatial patterns in marsh loss. For all tidal ranges, an increase in RSLR triggers channel widening, whereas a decrease in sediment supply triggers tidal flat deepening and increases wave edge erosion. Marsh loss by pond runaway expansion dominates for intermediate RSLR rates, especially for small tidal ranges and for small sediment supplies. Drowning only takes place in the microtidal setting for high RSLR rates and extremely low sediment supply. Drowning is restricted to the landward portion of the marsh, and lacks the variety of spatial scales associated with pond runaway. For a large tidal range, the amount of marsh loss by drowning and pond runaway is negligible, thus increasing the relative importance of edge erosion and channel widening. Upland migration deepens the channels, which release sediment and thus help sustaining the existing marsh. Nonetheless, marsh upland expansion compensates for existing marsh loss only for a large tidal range or for a high sediment supply, and thus microtidal marshes are likely to experience net loss. Marsh loss is highly heterogeneous, and is not well represented by the dichotomy between marsh survival and marsh loss based on vertical accretion thresholds. Marsh loss can take place by a variety of mechanisms, hindering the ability to generalize predictions about marsh loss.</abstract>

	<author>Bowen Ling, Ilenia Battiato</author>
	<abstract>Estimation of the permeability tensor is crucial for many natural and industrial porous media applications. Homogenization provides a rigorous framework to calculate effective parameters from pore-scale images of a representative unit cell of the porous medium by solving a boundary value problem, also known as closure problem, subject to global constraints. However, the latter are hard to satisfy for arbitrarily complex geometries. We have developed a novel computational algorithm to calculate rigorously the permeability tensor. The approach, here referred to as τ-SIMPLE, is based on introducing an artificial time scale τ to satisfy the global constraint within the SIMPLE iteration. We show that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional periodically arranged geometries.</abstract>

	<author>Mojtaba G. Mahmoodlu, Amir Raoof, Tom Bultreys, Jeroen Van Stappen, Veerle Cnudde</author>
	<abstract>Predicting the solute dispersivity in porous media is complicated by the known scale dependency of dispersion processes. In this study, we combined three complementary methods to investigate solute dispersivity at different length scales. The applied methods included 36-cm long column experiments, extremely large three-dimensional (3D) X-ray image-based pore network simulations, and Darcy scale modelling. We used X-ray imaging to extract the information on pore structures needed to construct a very long, 36-cm, pore network model. Doing so, for the first time, a direct comparison of the pore-scale model to the large experimental observations was performed. The longitudinal dispersivity was found to increase with length, with the rate of increase being lower at higher flow velocities. Results have shown that a pore network, which matches pore connectivity distribution and pore size distribution of a sub-sample of the column, is able to reproduce the experimentally observed solute breakthrough curves. Pore-scale modelling provided the extent of pore velocity variations corresponding to various locations along the experimental column as well as the one dimensional (1D) Darcy scale model. We have found that even in homogenous porous media immobile pores exist, with low velocities compared to the average velocity, which creates local concentration maximals.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A greyscale volumetric lattice Boltzmann method for upscaling pore-scale two-phase flow</paper_heading>
	<author>Senyou An, Yuting Zhan, Jun Yao, Huidan Whitney Yu, Vahid Niasar</author>
	<abstract>Solving image-based pore-scale flow and transport in porous materials is a mainstream of fundamental and industrial research to reveal the pertinent physics in the field of hydrogeology, reservoir engineering, paper and filter engineering. This research discipline requires tremendous integration of multidisciplinary research areas of image processing, computational fluid modelling, and high-performance computing. The key challenge in pore-scale multi-phase flow simulation is the overwhelming computational expense. In this paper, we develop a new computational method that integrates GPU-accelerated volumetric lattice Boltzmann method (VLBM) with an upscaling scheme to solve the pore-scale two-phase flow at the centimetre-level length scales. The lattice Boltzmann concept is employed to solve both the level-set equation for image segmentation and governing equations for multi-phase flow dynamics. The signed distance field solved from the level set equation is used to calculate the void volume ratio of each lattice cell, resulting in a seamless connection between image segmentation and computational fluid dynamics. The pore-scale porous materials upscaling is carried out through the average void volume ratio of the neighbouring cells. The algorithm is rigorously tested in three cases: contact angle test for droplets between two plates, co-current flow in a cylindrical tube, and the two-phase flow in a sandstone sample. For the sandstone sample, the porosity, void space topology, relative permeability and preferential flow channels are well retained after 8-times upscaling, while the computational time is dramatically decreased.</abstract>

	<author>Christophe Airiau, Alessandro Bottaro</author>
	<abstract>Pseudo-plastic fluids exhibit a non-linear stress-strain relationship which can provoke large, localized viscosity gradients. For the flow of such fluids in porous media the consequence is a strong variability of the effective permeability with porosity, angle of the macroscopic pressure gradient, and rheological parameters of the fluid. Such a variability is investigated on the basis of adjoint homogenization theory for a Carreau fluid in an idealized porous medium geometry, highlighting differences with respect to the Newtonian case. It is shown in particular that the more we depart from Newtonian conditions, the more the (often used) hypothesis of an effective viscosity in Darcy’s law is a poor approximation, for the effective permeability tensor becomes strongly anisotropic.</abstract>

	<author>Lichang Yin, Xiaoming Feng, Bojie Fu, Yongzhe Chen, ... Fulu Tao</author>
	<abstract>Quantifying and mapping regional and global irrigation water consumption have attracted considerable attention from researchers. The existing models cannot accurately estimate the long-term sequence of irrigation water consumption at the regional scale. Despite being among the countries with the largest irrigated areas, China has not been specifically evaluated in terms of high-resolution long-term irrigation water consumption. In this paper, an irrigated cropland water model incorporating irrigated cropland mapping, the soil water balance equation, irrigated crop phenology, and partitioning evapotranspiration products was developed to fill the knowledge gap. We found that (1) the mean annual total irrigation water consumption of irrigated cropland in China during 1982–2015 was approximately 179.43 ± 24.60 km3. (2) The continued expansion of irrigated farmland dominated (67.2% ± 5.6%) the significant increase in annual total irrigation water consumption (slope=2.03 km3 yr−1, p<0.01), followed by changes in crop management practices (16.7% ± 6.1%), and the impacts of interannual climatic variability (represented by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in this research) were weak. (3) The annual total irrigation water consumption in the arid zone increased quicker than that in wet regions.</abstract>

	<author>Michele La Rocca, Pietro Prestininzi, Lakshmanan Elango, Reinhard Hinkelmann, Andrea Montessori</author>
	<abstract>The collapse of a submerged granular pile under the action of the gravity force is investigated by means of a depth averaged model (hereinafter DAM). The granular pile is a mixture of solid particles and ambient liquid, totally covered by a layer of ambient liquid.The DAM is obtained by depth-averaging the mass and momentum equations of the mixture and the ambient fluid and is aimed at providing estimates of technical quantities regarding the considered phenomenon. The DAM is numerically solved by adopting an equivalent Discrete Boltzmann Equation model (hereinafter DBE) as solution method. The main advantage yielded by the DBE is the possibility to turn the original system of strongly non linear partial differential equations, which would require the resort to complex numerical schemes, into a purely advective, linear, first order one. Previously published experimental and numerical data, relative to the collapse of loose rectangular granular piles in water, are reproduced by the proposed model and a satisfactory agreement is found, revealing that the DAM is able to describe reliably the overall dynamics, in terms of quantities of technical interest as the height of the submerged granular flow and the instantaneous position of its front.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Impacts of secondary and quarter-diurnal tidal species on backwater hydrodynamics in tidal rivers</paper_heading>
	<author>Min Zhang, Hao Yang, Qibang Tang, Huayang Cai, ... Xin Tian</author>
	<abstract>As river flow debouches into the sea, it is affected by the tidal fluctuation at the estuary mouth, which results in a backwater zone, where the rising residual water level (averaged over a lunar day) in the landward direction is changing periodically. This is known as backwater hydrodynamics, especially the variation of the residual water levels that are controlled by the interplay between tide and river flows, while these hydrodynamics follow the traditional stage-river discharge relation in the upstream river-dominated region. However, the tidal asymmetry contributions to the residual water level that are caused by secondary tidal species (e.g., diurnal tide D1), overtide generation (e.g., the quarter-diurnal tide D4) and their interplay with river flow are poorly understood. In this study, we aim to understand the impacts of secondary and quarter-diurnal tidal species on the increase in residual water level in tidal rivers. To quantify the contributions made by different components, we decomposed the numerically computed subtidal friction into different components representing the contributions made by the river flow alone, the tide-river interaction, and tidal asymmetry due to the nonlinear interaction between different tidal species. The results show that the contribution by tidal asymmetry to the residual water level is minor, while the contributions by river flow and tide-river interaction are dominant, accounting for more than 90% and 80% at the upstream and downstream end of the estuary, respectively. The contribution made by river flow increases, while the tide-river interaction decreases in the landward direction. The semidiurnal tidal species (D2) predominantly control the residual water level induced by the tide-river interaction along the Yangtze estuary, which accounts for 70%, while the contributions made by the diurnal and quarter-diurnal tidal species are minor and comparable in magnitude in the seaward reach where tide-river interactions are important. The method proposed in this study to quantify the contributions of river flow and different tidal species to the residual water level will enhance our understanding of riverine and tidal impacts on estuarine backwater hydrodynamics and can be used to guide effective and sustainable water management in the Yangtze estuary and other tidal rivers with substantial river flow.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A review of SWAT applications, performance and future needs for simulation of hydro-climatic extremes</paper_heading>
	<author>Mou Leong Tan, Philip W. Gassman, Xiaoying Yang, James Haywood</author>
	<abstract>Hydro-climatic extremes, such as droughts and floods, have most likely increased due to climatic change and could lead to severe impacts on socio-economic, structural and environmental sectors. With nearly 4000 publications, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is clearly one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models worldwide. The model has been widely used for projecting the impacts of future hydro-climatic changes, but application for extreme streamflow conditions is still rarely reported. To date, SWAT application reviews have focused on compilations of SWAT studies for specific or relatively new applications such as eco-hydrological modelling, ecosystem services, sub-daily simulations, and pesticide fate and transport simulations. However, no existing SWAT review studies have focused on simulation of hydro-climatic extremes. Therefore, this research aims to bridge this gap by compiling and reviewing the findings of studies reporting SWAT hydro-climatic extremes including highlighting the performance and future research needs. A total of 111 articles have been identified since 1999; most of these studies were conducted in the United States and China. These articles can be divided into extreme flow assessments, drought studies, flood studies, drought and flood studies, SWAT coupling with other models, and SWAT improvements. Most of the extreme performance assessment studies reported “satisfactory” performance, with a particular emphasis on peak flow comparisons. Future research needs regarding this topic include: (1) a unified SWAT extreme performance assessment framework; (2) SWAT improvements that result in improved replication of peak and low flows; (3) reliability assessment of global and satellite products for SWAT extreme simulations; (4) bias correction of CMIP6 and regional climate projections; (5) comparison of SWAT+ and SWAT for extreme flow simulations in different types of basins; (6) development of an extreme flow module within an overall SWAT modelling system; and (7) integration of artificial intelligence within SWAT modelling.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A model to predict surface gas transfer rate in streams based on turbulence production by aquatic vegetation</paper_heading>
	<author>Chien-Yung Tseng, Rafael O. Tinoco</author>
	<abstract>Turbulence generated by aquatic vegetation in lakes, estuaries, and rivers can significantly alter the flow structure throughout the entire water column, affecting gas transfer mechanisms at the air-water interface, thus modifying indicators of water quality. A series of laboratory experiments with rigid, acrylic cylinder arrays to mimic vegetation was conducted in a recirculating Odell-Kovasznay type race-track flume. Particle Image Velocimetry was used to characterize mean and turbulent flow statistics, to investigate the effect of emergent and submerged vegetation on gas transfer rate in terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), Reynolds stresses, and TKE production. Surface gas transfer rates were determined by measuring dissolved oxygen concentration during re-aeration using an optical sensor. The results provided new insights on how stem- and canopy-scale turbulence affect the surface gas transfer rate at different submergence ratios and array densities. The relation between mean flow velocity and TKE production in each scenario is discussed, and a modified surface renewal model using TKE production as an indicator of gas transfer efficiency is developed to more accurately predict surface gas transfer rates in vegetated streams.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Potential of satellite and reanalysis evaporation datasets for hydrological modelling under various model calibration strategies</paper_heading>
	<author>Moctar Dembélé, Natalie Ceperley, Sander J. Zwart, Elga Salvadore, ... Bettina Schaefli</author>
	<abstract>Twelve actual evaporation datasets are evaluated for their ability to improve the performance of the fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM). The datasets consist of satellite-based diagnostic models (MOD16A2, SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, SEBS), satellite-based prognostic models (GLEAM v3.2a, GLEAM v3.3a, GLEAM v3.2b, GLEAM v3.3b), and reanalysis (ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55). Four distinct multivariate calibration strategies (basin-average, pixel-wise, spatial bias-accounting and spatial bias-insensitive) using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented, resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data. A process-diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in-situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from ESA-CCI and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. The method is implemented in the Volta River basin, which is a data scarce region in West Africa, for the period from 2003 to 2012. Results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration, but this is dependent on the calibration strategy. All the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflow-only calibration. The highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias-accounting strategy (+29%), followed by the spatial bias-insensitive strategy (+26%) and the pixel-wise strategy (+24%), while the basin-average strategy (+20%) gives the lowest improvement. On average, using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow (-7%), which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage (+11%), temporal dynamics of soil moisture (+6%) and spatial patterns of soil moisture (+89%). In general, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, GLEAM v3.3a and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5. However, performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones. These findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and advancing the spatiotemporal prediction of floods and droughts under climate and land use changes.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Effective flow and transport properties of heterogeneous unsaturated soils</paper_heading>
	<author>Veena S. Soraganvi, Rachid Ababou, M.S. Mohan Kumar</author>
	<abstract>The heterogeneity of field scale soils poses a challenge to predictive large scale flow and transport modeling. The theory of effective macroscale parameters holds good and is applicable in dealing with such problems. But the validity of the analytic stochastic solutions obtained for randomly heterogeneous soils is debatable, as the test cases under which they are validated are of limited scope due to linearization and perturbation approximations. In this study, samples of heterogeneous soils are generated using sets of spatially correlated random field parameters that are either geometrically isotropic, or else, geometrically anisotropic with either horizontal or vertical stratification (perfect or imperfect). Several combinations of ratios of correlation length and capillary dispersion lengths are considered. Numerical simulations of unsaturated flow are performed on each randomly heterogeneous soil sample. The principal components  of the macroscale effective unsaturated conductivity are then obtained as a function of the mean suction Ψ of the sample. They are compared to stochastic spectral perturbation theory, and to a probabilistic semi-empirical Power Average Model (PAM). They are also compared with arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean conductivity-suction curves. The numerically upscaled principal conductivity curves match quite well the PAM, better than the classical means (Arithmetic, Geometric, Harmonic), and also somewhat better than the curves obtained from stochastic spectral perturbation theory. It is observed that the upscaled principal components Kii(ψ), obtained numerically and with the PAM along directions “i” orthogonal/parallel to perfect stratification coincide with the harmonic/arithmetic mean curves at low suctions (i.e., near saturation), but deviate from it and come closer to the geometric mean at higher suctions. The PAM appears suitable for generation of approximate upscaled conductivity curves, e.g., for obtaining the mesh-scale or block-scale conductivity curves in large scale simulation codes. Transient solute transport simulations are then performed on the detailed random velocity fields obtained from the steady state simulations of unsaturated flow in the randomly heterogeneous soil samples. Snapshots of solute concentration C(x,z,t) are taken at different times. The temporal evolution of spatial moments of concentration is analyzed in order to characterize the macroscale advection and dispersion of the unsaturated concentration plume, and in particular, its macro-dispersion coefficient (D) and dispersivity length scale (A). For the synthetic soil samples considered in this study, the macro-dispersive spreading of the solute is stronger for flow parallel to vertical stratification, compared to flow perpendicular to horizontal stratification, and also, compared to flow in statistically isotropic non-stratified soil.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Study on the role of lateral unsaturated flow in triggering slope failure under varying boundary water level conditions</paper_heading>
	<author>Chengji Shen, Jie Sun, Xinzhou Zhang, Zhaoyang Luo, ... Chunhui Lu</author>
	<abstract>Lateral unsaturated flow was found to contribute little to rainfall-induced shallow landslides, but it can be important when the landslides are triggered under conditions of varying boundary water level. By considering a hillslope with an impermeable bedrock and rising water level at the uphill/downhill boundary, this study explored how lateral unsaturated flow would affect slope stability. Three different Hillslope-Storage Boussinesq models that differ in their treatment of the unsaturated flow were coupled with the same infinite slope stability model to predict and compare the safety factor and instability time. Specific to the situations considered, this study discovered that, despite the inclusion of lateral unsaturated flow effect, the hillslope remains stable when water level at the downhill boundary rises. Under the condition of increasing uphill boundary water level, the consideration of lateral unsaturated flow leads to earlier slope failure for loamy hillslopes with a moderate slope. Also, the lateral unsaturated flow may not induce slope failure for mildly sloping loamy hillslopes and plays an ignorable role when landslides occur fast in very steep hillslopes. By contrast, the lateral unsaturated flow does not affect much the failure of sandy hillslopes. Moreover, when water level at the uphill boundary increases faster, the lateral unsaturated flow exerts a greater influence on initiating slope failure. Further examination shows that intensive rainfall may weaken the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on shallow landslides triggering under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level.

	<paper_heading>Capillary rise in vuggy media</paper_heading>
	<author>Hasan J. Khan, Ayaz Mehmani, Maša Prodanović, David DiCarlo, Dayeed J. Khan</author>
	<abstract>Carbonates can be highly heterogeneous formations with large variations in pore size distribution and pore space topology, which results in complex multiphase flow behavior. Here we investigate the spontaneous imbibition behavior of fluids in vuggy carbonates. Glass beads of 1.0 mm diameter, with dissolvable vug placeholders, are sintered to form multiple configurations of heterogeneous vuggy core with variations in matrix porosity, vug size, vug spatial location, and number of vugs. The core fabrication process is repeatable and allows the impact of vug textural properties to be investigated in a controlled manner. Capillary rise experiments are conducted in these proxy vuggy carbonate core and compared with the homogeneous non-vuggy core as reference. Continuous optical imaging is performed to track the position of the air-water interface in the cores. To understand the change in capillary height in the presence of a vug, a volume-of-fluid two-phase numerical simulation is performed in a parallel set of connected and disconnected tubes. Finally x-ray tomography scans are performed to identify the shape of the air-water interface in a select few cores. The results can be summarized as follows: disconnected vugs result in higher capillary rise compared to non-vuggy porous media. The vugs act as capillary barriers, diverting fluid flow to the adjacent connected channels, which ultimately results in a higher overall capillary rise. The results of this work highlight that radius of spontaneous invasion of aqueous phases, such as fracture fluid and hazardous wastes, are affected by vug porosity but not their distribution.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Water level and mobilisation of colloids in porous media</paper_heading>
	<author>Larissa Chequer, Pavel Bedrikovetsky, Alexander Badalyan, Vitaly Gitis</author>
	<abstract>Unforeseen clogging and low well productivity during exploitation of oil and gas reservoirs result from a mobilisation of densely deposited particles. The proposed model predicts the mobilisation in unsaturated porous media based on the changes in water level, and hydrophilicity and size of mobilisable particles. Domains of particle attachment, sliding, rolling, and lifting were found from a phase diagram based on a mechanical equilibrium. The degree of mobilisation was correlated with experimental data through a maximum retention function. The validity of the proposed model was confirmed by a close match of theoretical predictions with results of 46 laboratory tests on particle detachment. Our analysis shows that it is practically impossible to remove 2 μm charged colloids from a dry porous media. Nearly desalinated water with ionic strength of 0.001 M or less are needed to mobilise particles in saturated media at typical groundwater conditions. A gradual increase in water level is key for mobilisation in unsaturated media. The proposed model can be used to forecast a potential well clogging.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A comparison of estimators of the conditional mean under non-stationary conditions</paper_heading>
	<author>Richard M. Vogel, Charles N. Kroll</author>
	<abstract>There is increasing attention to the development of a myriad of complex methods for nonstationary frequency analysis (NFA) of floods, droughts and other hydrologic processes. We assume that the need for NFA arises from well understood deterministic mechanisms of change. A common assumption in NFA, questioned here, is that more accurate estimators of hydrologic statistics result when more realistic, complex and sophisticated models are employed. By considering the mean annual flood (drought or other hydrologic event), general conditions are derived when the sample mean (SM) is a more efficient (lower mean square error, MSE) estimator than a regression estimate of the mean (RM). We introduce an optimal fractional mean estimator, FM*, which is simply the SM of the most recent period of record nf*, where f* is the optimal fraction of the full sample n, which leads to minimum MSE among all possible values of f. Interestingly, FM* is generally preferred over RM for attained significance levels associated with the fitted regression model in excess of about 0.05. Given the considerable attention and uncertainty surrounding potential nonstationary conditions, we demonstrate that a parsimonious estimator which exploits an optimal recent subset of the historical record may be more attractive than many of the more complex nonstationary approaches commonly advocated.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Direct simulation of non-additive properties on unstructured grids</paper_heading>
	<author>Pauline Mourlanette, Pierre Biver, Philippe Renard, Benoît Nœtinger, ... Yassine Alexandre Perrier</author>
	<abstract>Uncertainties related to permeability heterogeneity can be estimated using geostatistical simulation methods. Usually, these methods are applied on regular grids with cells of constant size, whereas unstructured grids are more flexible to honor geological structures and offer local refinements for fluid-flow simulations. However, cells of different sizes require to account for the support dependency of permeability statistics (support effect). This paper presents a novel workflow based on the power averaging technique. The averaging exponent ω is estimated using a response surface calibrated from numerical upscaling experiments. Using spectral turning bands, permeability is simulated on points in each unstructured cell, and later averaged with a local value of ω that depends on the cell size and shape. The method is illustrated on a synthetic case. The simulation of a tracer experiment is used to compare this novel geostatistical simulation method with a conventional approach based on a fine scale Cartesian grid. The results show the consistency of both the simulated permeability fields and the tracer breakthrough curves. The computational cost is much lower than the conventional approach based on a pressure-solver upscaling.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>Numerical investigation of flow instabilities using fully unstructured discretization for variably saturated flow problems</paper_heading>
	<author>Danyang Su, K. Ulrich Mayer, Kerry T.B. MacQuarrie</author>
	<abstract>Richards equation for variably saturated flow can exhibit stability problems due to its nonlinearity. The challenge is to resolve sharp wetting fronts without introducing spurious oscillations, especially for simulations with very dry initial conditions. Flow instabilities at sharp wetting fronts may arise particularly in anisotropic and heterogeneous media, leading to oscillations or convergence problems. The focus of this work is to evaluate and minimize instability problems for simulations with unstructured meshes. To this end, numerical experiments were performed to investigate the accuracy, monotonicity and convergence behavior of numerical solutions for variably saturated flow based on different control volume methods, piecewise gradient reconstruction methods, and flux approximation methods. In particular, nonphysical oscillations at the wetting front were investigated. A novel multi-point flux approximation with multi-point upstream weighting based on piecewise gradient reconstruction was developed. Numerical simulations in both homogeneous and heterogeneous domains with isotropic and anisotropic conductivity tensors demonstrate that the proposed multi-point flux approximation with multi-point upstream weighting avoids spurious oscillations and improves the results for challenging sharp wetting front problems using general unstructured meshes as well as meshes with distortion. The revised Voronoi-dual control volume method has also been found to provide more flexibility than commonly used center-dual and median-dual control volume methods.</abstract>

	<paper_heading>A benchmark study of the multiscale and homogenization methods for fully implicit multiphase flow simulations</paper_heading>
	<author>Hadi Hajibeygi, Manuela Bastidas Olivares, Mousa HosseiniMehr, Sorin Pop, Mary Wheeler</author>
	<abstract>Accurate simulation of multiphase flow in subsurface formations is challenging, as the formations span large length scales (km) with high-resolution heterogeneous properties. To deal with this challenge, different multiscale methods have been developed. Such methods construct coarse-scale systems, based on a given high-resolution fine-scale system. Furthermore, they are amenable to parallel computing and allow for a-posteriori error control. The multiscale methods differ from each other in the way the transition between the different scales is made. Multiscale (finite element and finite volume) methods compute local basis functions to map the solutions (e.g. pressure) between coarse and fine scales. Instead, homogenization methods solve local periodic problems to determine effective models and parameters (e.g. permeability) at a coarser scale. It is yet unknown how these two methods compare with each other, especially when applied to complex geological formations, with no clear scale separation in the property fields. This paper develops the first comparison benchmark study of these two methods and extends their applicability to fully implicit simulations using the algebraic dynamic multilevel (ADM) method. At each time step, on the given fine-scale mesh and based on an error analysis, the fully implicit system is solved on a dynamic multilevel grid. The entries of this system are obtained by using multiscale local basis functions (ADM-MS), and, respectively, by homogenization over local domains (ADM-HO). Both sets of local basis functions (ADM-MS) and local effective parameters (ADM-HO) are computed at the beginning of the simulation, with no further updates during the multiphase flow simulation. The two methods are extended and implemented in the same open-source DARSim2 simulator (https://gitlab.com/darsim2simulator), to provide fair quality comparisons. The results reveal insightful understanding of the two approaches, and qualitatively benchmark their performance. It is re-emphasized that the test cases considered here include permeability fields with no clear scale separation. The development of this paper sheds new lights on advanced multiscale methods for simulation of coupled processes in porous media.</abstract>
